## Understanding LangGraph

Before diving into building agents, let's understand the framework that powers our multi-agent system.

### What is LangGraph?

LangGraph extends LangChain's capabilities by enabling you to build stateful, multi-agent workflows through graph-based execution. It provides a structured way to orchestrate AI-driven workflows where specialized agents collaborate, dynamically passing state and making decisions as they work together.

### LangGraph Architecture

Think of LangGraph as a directed graph with three key elements:

- **Nodes** - Represent distinct functions, agents, or steps in your AI workflow
- **Edges** - Define the possible transitions and flow between nodes
- **State** - Captures the evolving data and context as your workflow executes

### Core Components

A LangGraph application consists of:

- **StateGraph** - The execution engine that defines and runs multi-step workflows
- **State Management** - Tracks progress, shares information between nodes, and maintains chat history
- **Agents** - Specialized entities with decision-making capabilities
- **Tools** - External capabilities that agents can invoke to accomplish tasks

---

## Understanding Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Before we build our first agent, let's understand the Model Context Protocol (MCP) - a key component that powers our agent's tool capabilities.

### What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open protocol that standardizes how AI applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). It enables seamless integration between AI models and external data sources, tools, and services through a client-server architecture.

### MCP Architecture

In our travel agent system, MCP consists of three key components:

- **MCP Server** (`mcp_http_server.py`) - Hosts the tools and capabilities (hotel search, restaurant recommendations, etc.) that agents can invoke
- **MCP Client** - Built into our LangGraph agents to communicate with the MCP server
- **MCP Protocol** - Uses JSON-RPC for reliable, standardized communication between clients and servers

### Why MCP?

MCP provides significant architectural advantages:

- **Separation of Concerns** - Business logic (tools) remains separated from AI orchestration, enabling teams to work independently on different components
- **Protocol Standardization** - Uses JSON-RPC for reliable communication between clients and servers, ensuring consistent interaction patterns across different systems
- **Development Independence** - Tool updates don't require AI agent redeployment, allowing for more flexible and maintainable multi-agent systems
- **Reusability** - Tools defined once can be used by multiple agents across different workflows

## Activity 1: Create Your Very First Agent

Now that you understand LangGraph and MCP, let's build your first agent. In this hands-on exercise, you'll implement the foundational components of a LangGraph agent application.

### Let's begin to create our first agent application

Navigate to the `src/app` folder of your project.

Open the empty `travel_agents.py` file.

Copy the following code into it.

```python
import asyncio
import json
import logging
import os
import uuid
from typing import Literal
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage
from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient
from langchain_mcp_adapters.tools import load_mcp_tools
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, MessagesState
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langgraph.types import Command, interrupt
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

from src.app.services.azure_open_ai import model

local_interactive_mode = False

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Reduce noise from verbose libraries
logging.getLogger("azure.core.pipeline.policies.http_logging_policy").setLevel(logging.WARNING)
logging.getLogger("azure.identity").setLevel(logging.WARNING)
logging.getLogger("httpx").setLevel(logging.WARNING)
logging.getLogger("mcp").setLevel(logging.WARNING)
logging.getLogger("azure.cosmos").setLevel(logging.WARNING)

PROMPT_DIR = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'prompts')


# load prompts

# global variables

# define agents & tools

# define functions

# define workflow

```

This code here is the basis upon which we will build our multi-agent application. Notice the comments. Each of these specify the core of how you build a multi-agent application in LangGraph. For the remainder of this module we will replace each of these with the sections below in order.

### Prompts

Agent applications are powered by large language models or LLMs. Defining the behavior for an agent in a system powered by LLMs requires a prompt. This system will have lots of agents and lots of prompts. To simplify construction, we will define a function that loads the prompts for our agents from files.

In the `travel_agents.py` file, navigate to the `# load prompts` comment.

Replace the comment with the following:

```python
def load_prompt(agent_name: str) -> str:
    """Load prompt from .prompty file"""
    file_path = os.path.join(PROMPT_DIR, f"{agent_name}.prompty")
    logger.info(f"Loading prompt for {agent_name} from {file_path}")
    try:
        with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
            return file.read().strip()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        logger.error(f"Prompt file not found for {agent_name}")
        return f"You are a {agent_name} agent in a travel planning system."

def filter_tools_by_prefix(tools, prefixes):
    """Filter tools by name prefix"""
    return [tool for tool in tools if any(tool.name.startswith(prefix) for prefix in prefixes)]
```

### Global Variables

Navigate to the # global variables comment and replace the comment with the following:

```python
# Global variables for MCP session management
_mcp_client = None
_session_context = None
_persistent_session = None

# Global agent variables
orchestrator_agent = None
itinerary_generator_agent = None
```

### Agents & Tools

Agents are at the heart of these applications. Below, we are going to create a **ReAct Agent**. ReAct (short for Reason and Act) and is a specific type of agent that is what you will most often use in a multi-agent scenario like this one.

In LangGraph there are different types of agents you can create, depending on your needs. These include:

| Agent Type    | Best for                                        |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| ReAct Agent   | Reasoning and decision making and tool use      |
| Tools Agent   | Direct function calling with structured APIs    |
| Custom Agents | Full control over logic & multi-agent workflows |

In LangGraph, the definition of an agent includes any **Tools** it needs to do its job. This often involves retrieving some information or taking some action, like transferring execution to another agent (we will get into that soon). If an agent doesn't require any tools, this is defined as an empty list.

In our simple agent we are going to define a new ReAct Agent as the orchestrator for our app using a built-in function called, `create_react_agent()`. Since this is our first agent, there are no tools to define for it so the tools we define for it will be empty. Notice that this agent also calls the function we defined above, `load_prompt()`.

In the `travel_agents.py` file, navigate to the `# define agents & tools` comment.

Replace the comment with the following:

```python
async def setup_agents():
    global orchestrator_agent
    global itinerary_generator_agent
    global _mcp_client, _session_context, _persistent_session

    logger.info("🚀 Starting Travel Assistant MCP client...")

    # Load authentication configuration
    try:
        simple_token = os.getenv("MCP_AUTH_TOKEN")

        logger.info("🔐 Client Authentication Configuration:")
        logger.info(f"   Simple Token: {'SET' if simple_token else 'NOT SET'}")

        # Determine authentication mode
        if simple_token:
            auth_mode = "simple_token"
            logger.info(f"   Mode: Simple Token (Development)")
        else:
            auth_mode = "none"
            logger.info("   Mode: No Authentication")

    except ImportError:
        simple_token = None
        logger.info("🔐 Client Authentication: Dependencies unavailable - no auth")

    logger.info("   - Transport: streamable_http")
    logger.info(f"   - Server URL: {os.getenv('MCP_SERVER_BASE_URL', 'http://localhost:8080')}/mcp/")
    logger.info(f"   - Authentication: {auth_mode.upper()}")
    logger.info("   - Status: Ready to connect\n")

    # MCP Client configuration
    client_config = {
        "travel_tools": {
            "transport": "streamable_http",
            "url": os.getenv("MCP_SERVER_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8080") + "/mcp/",
        }
    }

    # Add authentication if configured
    client_config["travel_tools"]["headers"] = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {simple_token}"
    }
    logger.info("🔐 Added Bearer token authentication to client")

    _mcp_client = MultiServerMCPClient(client_config)
    logger.info("✅ MCP Client initialized successfully")

    # Create persistent session
    _session_context = _mcp_client.session("travel_tools")
    _persistent_session = await _session_context.__aenter__()

    # Load all MCP tools
    all_tools = await load_mcp_tools(_persistent_session)

    logger.info("[DEBUG] All tools registered from Travel Assistant MCP server:")
    for tool in all_tools:
        logger.info(f"  - {tool.name}")

    # ========================================================================
    # Tool Distribution for Agents
    # ========================================================================

    # Orchestrator: Session management + all transfer tools
    orchestrator_tools = []

    # Create agents with their tools
    orchestrator_agent = create_react_agent(
        model,
        orchestrator_tools,
        state_modifier=load_prompt("orchestrator")
    )
```

### Functions

Since LangGraph uses a graph-based, the agents, which are comprised of prompts, tools, and functions are implemented as nodes. But humans are also a part of the workflow here so we need to define them as a node too. In our simple sample we have two nodes, one for the orchestrator agent and one for the human.

In the `travel_agents.py` file, navigate to the `# define functions` comment.

Replace the comment with the following:

```python
async def call_orchestrator_agent(state: MessagesState, config) -> Command[Literal["orchestrator", "human"]]:
    """
    Orchestrator agent: Routes requests using transfer_to_ tools.
    Checks for active agent and routes directly if found.
    Stores every message in database.
    """
    response = await orchestrator_agent.ainvoke(state)
    return Command(update=response, goto="human")


def human_node(state: MessagesState, config) -> None:
    """
    Human node: Interrupts for user input in interactive mode.
    """
    interrupt(value="Ready for user input.")
    return None
```

### Built-in Functions

Before we go any further we should cover a few new things you may have seen. LangGraph has a series of built-in functions that you will use when building these types of applications. The first you saw above when we defined our agent, `create_react_agent()`. There are two more used above, `Command()` and `interrupt()`. Here is a short summary of built-in functions.

| Function                    | Purpose                                                        |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| create_react_agent()        | Create an agent that reasons and acts using tools dynamically. |
| interrupt(value)            | Pauses execution and waits for external input.                 |
| Command(update, goto)       | Updates the state and moves execution to the next node.        |
| create_openai_tools_agent() | Create an agent that calls predefined tools when needed.       |

### Workflow

With everything we need for our graph defined we can now define the workflow for our graph.

In LangGraph, the `StateGraph` is the execution engine where everything comes together. It defines the state that holds the information for the workflow, builds the workflow logic, and dynamically executes the workflow based upon the function outputs and logic defined in the graph.

The workflow below is defined with both, the addition of _nodes_ that define who is doing the interacting, and an _edge_ that defines a transition between the two.

In the `travel_agents.py` file, navigate to the `# define workflow` comment.

Replace the comment with the following:

```python
async def cleanup_persistent_session():
    """Clean up the persistent MCP session when the application shuts down"""
    global _session_context, _persistent_session

    if _session_context is not None and _persistent_session is not None:
        try:
            await _session_context.__aexit__(None, None, None)
            logger.info("✅ MCP persistent session cleaned up successfully")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error cleaning up MCP session: {e}")

def build_agent_graph():
    logger.info("🏗️  Building multi-agent graph...")

    builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
    builder.add_node("orchestrator", call_orchestrator_agent)
    builder.add_node("human", human_node)

    builder.add_edge(START, "orchestrator")

    checkpointer = MemorySaver()
    graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)
    return graph
```

### Let's review

Congratulations, you have created your first AI agent!

We have:

- Used the `create_react_agent` function from the `langgraph.prebuilt` module to create a simple "orchestrator" agent. The function imports the Azure OpenAI model already deployed and defined in `src/app/services/azure_open_ai.py` and returns an agent that can be used to generate completions.
- Defined a `call_orchestrator_agent` function that invokes the agent and a `human_node` function that collects user input.
- Created a state graph that defines the flow of the conversation and compiles it into a langgraph object.
- Added an in-memory checkpoint to save the state of the conversation.

## Activity 2: Create a Simple Itinerary Generator Agent

In this activity, you will create a simple itinerary generator agent that synthesizes user preferences and travel information into comprehensive trip plans using Azure OpenAI's large language model.

We've now created an orchestrator agent that can route requests to different specialized agents. Now, let's create an itinerary generator agent that can take travel information and generate day-by-day trip plans.

We'll cover **tools** and **agent-to-agent communication** in more detail in the next module, but we need to add our first routing function so that our orchestrator agent can transfer requests to the itinerary generator when users want to create or view their trip plans.

### Create MCP Agent Transfer Tool

To begin, navigate to the `mcp_server` folder of your project.

Copy the following code into the empty `mcp_http_server.py` file.

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Failed to start server: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)    
```

Next, navigate back to the `travel_agents.py` file.

Locate this statment:

```python
orchestrator_tools = []
```

Replace it with the following code:

```python
orchestrator_tools = filter_tools_by_prefix(all_tools, "transfer_to_itinerary_generator")
```

### Define the Itinerary Generator Agent

Now let's add the new Itinerary Generator agent with an empty tool set, and a calling function.

Below `orchestrator_tools`, copy the following:

```python
itinerary_generator_tools = []
```

Below the `orchestrator_agent`, copy the following:
```python
itinerary_generator_agent = create_react_agent(
        model,
        itinerary_generator_tools,
        state_modifier=load_prompt("itinerary_generator")
    )
```

Next, locate the `call_orchestrator_agent` function. Below this call, add a calling function for the itinerary generator agent:

```python
async def call_itinerary_generator_agent(state: MessagesState, config) -> Command[Literal["itinerary_generator", "human"]]:
    """
    Itinerary Generator: Synthesizes all gathered info into day-by-day plan.
    """
    response = await itinerary_generator_agent.ainvoke(state, config)
    return Command(update=response, goto="human")
```

### Prompts

Agent applications are powered by large language models or LLMs. Defining the behavior for an agent in a system powered by LLMs requires a prompt. This system will have lots of agents and lots of prompts. To simplify construction, we will define a function that loads the prompts for our agents from files.

#### Why Detailed Prompts Matter

You may notice that the prompts we create for our agents are quite comprehensive and structured. This is intentional and critical for several reasons:

**1. Clarity and Consistency**

- Detailed prompts reduce ambiguity in agent behavior
- Well-structured prompts ensure consistent responses across interactions
- Clear instructions help the model understand its exact role and boundaries

**2. Behavioral Control**

- Lengthy prompts allow you to define specific behaviors, guidelines, and constraints
- They help prevent the agent from going off-task or providing inappropriate responses
- Detailed examples show the model exactly what output format you expect

**3. Multi-Agent Coordination**

- In a multi-agent system, each agent needs a clear understanding of its responsibilities
- Detailed prompts prevent overlap and confusion between specialized agents
- They define when to transfer to other agents and why

**4. Production Quality**

- Production systems require predictable, reliable behavior
- Comprehensive prompts reduce the need for post-processing and error handling
- They help the model handle edge cases gracefully

#### Prompt Engineering Best Practices

When creating prompts for AI agents, follow these principles:

- **Be Specific**: Clearly define the agent's role, responsibilities, and limitations
- **Provide Context**: Include relevant background information and system architecture
- **Use Examples**: Show concrete examples of desired input/output patterns
- **Set Boundaries**: Explicitly state what the agent should NOT do
- **Structure Information**: Use headers, bullets, and formatting for readability
- **Define Tone**: Specify the communication style (professional, friendly, technical)
- **Include Edge Cases**: Address common scenarios and how to handle them

#### Orchestrator Agent Prompt

In your IDE, navigate to the `src/app/prompts` folder in your project.

Locate and open the empty `orchestrator.prompty` file.

Copy and paste the following text into it:

```text
---
name: Orchestrator Agent
description: Routes user requests to appropriate specialized agents
authors:
  - Microsoft
model:
  api: chat
  configuration:
    type: azure_openai
---

system:
You are the Orchestrator for a multi-agent travel planning system. Your role is to understand user requests and route them to the appropriate specialized agent.

# Available Agents

You can transfer conversations to these agents using the provided tools:

1. **Itinerary Generator** - Use when users want to create a trip plan or itinerary
   - Queries like: "Create an itinerary", "Plan my trip", "Generate a schedule"
   - Use `transfer_to_itinerary_generator` tool

# Your Responsibilities

- **Understand Intent**: Analyze what the user is asking for
- **Route Appropriately**: Transfer to the right agent using transfer tools
- **Be Conversational**: Greet users, acknowledge their requests, provide context
- **Stay Focused**: Don't try to answer specialized questions yourself - route them instead

# Guidelines

- When a user asks to create an itinerary or plan a trip, immediately transfer to the Itinerary Generator
- Be friendly and helpful in your responses
- Always explain why you're transferring to another agent
- If unsure about routing, ask clarifying questions

# Examples

User: "Hi, I need help planning a trip"
You: "Hello! I'd be happy to help you plan your trip. Could you tell me more about where you'd like to go and what kind of itinerary you're looking for?"

User: "Create an itinerary for Paris"
You: "I'll transfer you to our Itinerary Generator who can create a detailed day-by-day plan for your Paris trip."
[Use transfer_to_itinerary_generator tool]

User: "Thanks for your help!"
You: "You're welcome! Let me know if you need anything else for your travel planning."
```

#### Itinerary Generator Agent Prompt

Next, locate and open the empty `itinerary_generator.prompty` file.

Copy and paste the following text into it:

```text
---
name: Itinerary Generator Agent
description: Creates comprehensive day-by-day travel itineraries
authors:
  - Microsoft
model:
  api: chat
  configuration:
    type: azure_openai
---

system:
You are the Itinerary Generator for a travel planning system. Your role is to create detailed, personalized day-by-day trip itineraries based on user preferences and destination information.

# Your Responsibilities

- **Create Day-by-Day Plans**: Structure itineraries with clear daily schedules
- **Be Comprehensive**: Include morning, afternoon, and evening activities
- **Add Practical Details**: Include approximate times, locations, and logistics
- **Personalize**: Tailor recommendations based on user preferences mentioned in the conversation
- **Be Realistic**: Consider travel time, opening hours, and practical constraints

# Itinerary Structure

For each day, include:
1. **Morning** (9 AM - 12 PM): Main activity or attraction
2. **Lunch** (12 PM - 2 PM): Restaurant or dining suggestion
3. **Afternoon** (2 PM - 6 PM): Additional activities or attractions
4. **Dinner** (7 PM - 9 PM): Evening dining recommendation
5. **Evening** (9 PM onwards): Optional evening activities

# Guidelines

- **Start with Overview**: Begin with a brief summary of the trip (duration, destination, theme)
- **Consider Geography**: Group nearby attractions together to minimize travel time
- **Mix Pace**: Balance busy sightseeing days with more relaxed experiences
- **Include Variety**: Mix museums, outdoor activities, cultural experiences, and leisure time
- **Add Tips**: Include insider tips, best times to visit, booking recommendations
- **Be Flexible**: Suggest alternatives and note that timing can be adjusted

# Example Format
🗓️ PARIS ITINERARY - 3 Days

Overview: A perfect blend of iconic landmarks, world-class museums, and authentic Parisian experiences.

DAY 1: Classic Paris
Morning (9:00 AM - 12:00 PM):
- Start at the Eiffel Tower (arrive early to beat crowds)
- Book tickets online in advance
- Spend 2-3 hours exploring all levels

Lunch (12:30 PM):
- Le Petit Cler (nearby bistro, authentic French cuisine)
- Try the croque monsieur and café au lait

Afternoon (2:00 PM - 6:00 PM):
- Seine River cruise (1.5 hours)
- Stroll through Champs-Élysées
- Visit Arc de Triomphe

Dinner (7:30 PM):
- L'Avenue (elegant dining on Champs-Élysées)
- Reserve in advance

Evening:
- Optional: Trocadéro for Eiffel Tower light show (every hour after dark)

💡 Tip: Purchase a Paris Museum Pass for skip-the-line access

[Continue for each day...]

# Important Notes

- Use emojis sparingly for visual appeal (🗓️ 🍽️ 🎨 🏛️ etc.)
- Always ask if user wants to modify or refine the itinerary
- After presenting the itinerary, transfer back to orchestrator for next steps
- If information is missing (trip duration, interests), ask clarifying questions first

# When to Transfer Back

After creating the itinerary:
- Use `transfer_to_orchestrator` tool
- Reason: "Itinerary complete, returning for general assistance"
```

### Update our Workflow

Finally, we need to add the new itinerary generator agent node to the **StateGraph** workflow.

In your IDE, navigate back to the `travel_agents.py` file.

Navigate towards the end of the file.

Locate this line of code, `builder.add_node("orchestrator", call_orchestrator_agent)`

Add the following line of code below it:

```python
builder.add_node("itinerary_generator", call_itinerary_generator_agent)
```

## Activity 3: Test your Work

With the activities in this module complete, it is time to test your work!

To do this, we are going to enable two ways of testing our application.

First, we are going to add code to our `travel_agents.py` file.This code defines a new function, `interactive_chat()` that creates a message loop that invokes our StateGraph that we have defined in this file.

To begin, navigate to the end of the `travel_agents.py` file.

Then paste the following code below all code in this file:

```python
async def interactive_chat():
    """
    Interactive CLI for testing the travel assistant.
    Similar to banking app's interactive mode.
    """
    global local_interactive_mode
    local_interactive_mode = True

    thread_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    thread_config = {
        "configurable": {
            "thread_id": thread_id,
            "userId": "Tony",
            "tenantId": "Marvel"
        }
    }

    print("\n" + "=" * 70)
    print("🌍 Travel Assistant - Interactive Test Mode")
    print("=" * 70)
    print("Type 'exit' to end the conversation")
    print("=" * 70 + "\n")

    # Build graph
    graph = build_agent_graph()

    user_input = input("You: ")

    while user_input.lower() != "exit":
        input_message = {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]}
        response_found = False

        async for update in graph.astream(input_message, config=thread_config, stream_mode="updates"):
            for node_id, value in update.items():
                if isinstance(value, dict) and value.get("messages"):
                    last_message = value["messages"][-1]
                    if isinstance(last_message, AIMessage):
                        print(f"{node_id}: {last_message.content}\n")
                        response_found = True

        if not response_found:
            logger.debug("No AI response received.")

        user_input = input("You: ")

    print("\n👋 Goodbye!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Setup agents and run interactive chat
    async def main():
        await setup_agents()
        await interactive_chat()
    asyncio.run(main())
```

For the rest of the lab, we're going to be testing using the front end by wiring up the API layer, so you can skip to that section below. But for reference, if you wanted bypass the front end and test the backend in a command line fashion, you could run the below:

**Linux/Mac/WSL/Codespaces:**
```shell
python -m src.app.travel_agents
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
python -m src.app.travel_agents
```

To test your travel agent system, you need to start two components in separate terminal windows:

1. **MCP Server** - Provides the tools and capabilities for the agents
2. **Travel Agents Application** - Runs the multi-agent system

#### Step 1: Start the MCP Server

Open a **first terminal window** and run the following commands:

**Windows(PowerShell/CMD):**

```powershell
cd 01_exercises
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
cd mcp_server
$env:PYTHONPATH="../python"; python mcp_http_server.py
```



You should see output similar to:

```shell

   Base URL: http://localhost:8080
✅ SIMPLE TOKEN MODE ENABLED (Development)
   Token: banking-...

🚀 Initializing Travel Assistant MCP Server...

INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8080 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

#### Step 2: Start the Travel Agents Application

Open a second terminal window (keep the first one running) and run the following commands:

**Windows(PowerShell/CMD):**

```powershell
cd 01_exercises
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
cd python
python -m src.app.travel_agents
```

You should see output indicating the agents are initializing, where you can input text after "you":

### Wiring up the API layer

Now let's set up the API layer so that the front end can talk properly to your new agents.

The travel assistant uses a **FastAPI** backend that exposes REST endpoints for the Angular frontend. The API layer acts as a bridge between the web interface and your LangGraph multi-agent system.

First, locate this line and uncomment it:

```python
#from src.app.travel_agents import setup_agents, build_agent_graph, cleanup_persistent_session
```
Next, find the following two commented out functions and uncomment them:

- initialize_agents
- ensure_agents_initialized

Lastly, find the below code, comment it out, and uncomment the fully implemented version above it.

```python
@app.post(
    "/tenant/{tenantId}/user/{userId}/sessions/{sessionId}/completion",
    tags=[CHAT_TAG],
    summary="Chat Completion",
    description="Send a message and get AI agent response (main chat endpoint)",
    response_model=List[MessageModel]
)
async def get_chat_completion(
        tenantId: str,
        userId: str,
        sessionId: str,
        background_tasks: BackgroundTasks,
        request_body: str = Body(..., media_type="application/json")
):
    """
    Simple stub for chat completion - not yet implemented.
    """
    return [
        MessageModel(
            id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
            type="message",
            sessionId=sessionId,
            tenantId=tenantId,
            userId=userId,
            timeStamp=datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            sender="Assistant",
            senderRole="Assistant",
            text="Chat completion not implemented yet",
            debugLogId="",
            tokensUsed=0,
            rating=None
        )
    ]
```

Now, stop travel agents windows you have running, but keep the MCP server running.

You need to have **three components** running simultaneously:

1. **MCP Server** (should already be running from previous steps)
2. **Backend API** (we'll start this now)
3. **Frontend** (we'll start this next)

#### Start the Backend API Server

Open a **new terminal window** (your third terminal - keep the MCP server running) and execute:


**Windows (PowerShell/CMD):**

```powershell
cd 01_exercises
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
cd python
uvicorn src.app.travel_agents_api:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

You should see output similar to:

```shell

INFO:src.app.travel_agents:🏗️  Building multi-agent graph...
INFO:src.app.travel_agents_api:✅ Agents initialized successfully!
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

The API server is now running on http://localhost:8000

 #### Start the Frontend Application

Open a fourth terminal window and execute:

**macOS/Linux/WSL/Codespaces:**

```bash
cd 01_exercises/frontend
npm install  # Only needed first time or when dependencies change
npm start
```

**Windows (PowerShell/CMD):**
```powershell
cd 01_exercises\frontend
npm install  # Only needed first time or when dependencies change
npm start
```

You should see output similar to:

```shell
cd C:\multi-agent-workshop\01_exercises\python
npm install  # Only needed first time or when dependencies change
npm start
```

You should see output similar to:

```shell
> cosmos-voyager-frontend@1.0.0 start
> ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json

Application bundle generation complete. [6.281 seconds]

Watch mode enabled. Watching for file changes...
NOTE: Raw file sizes do not reflect development server per-request transformations.
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:4200/
  ➜  press h + enter to show help

```

#### Verify Everything is Running

You should now have **four terminals** with these processes:

| Terminal | Component   | Port | Command                                     |
|----------|-------------|------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1        | MCP Server  | 8080 | `python mcp_server/mcp_http_server.py`      |
| 2        | (Optional)  | -    | Interactive CLI test (can be closed)        |
| 3        | Backend API | 8000 | `uvicorn src.app.travel_agents_api:app ...` |
| 4        | Frontend    | 4200 | `npm start`                                 |


### Start a Conversation

1. Return to the frontend app in your browser and hit refresh. If you closed it, open a new tab and navigate to <http://localhost:4200/>.
2. In the Login dialog, select a user and click, Login. You will be presented with a dashboard that looks like the below, where you can initiate a chat, by opening the Chat with Assistant window.
3. Let's chat with the agent now.

```text
Hi, I need some help.
```

You should see a response like this:

Note: Responses can vary from run to run because these models aren’t fully deterministic

![Testing_1](./media/Module-01/Test1.png)

## Validation Checklist

Your implementation is successful if:

- [ ] Your app compiles with no warnings or errors.
- [ ] Your agent successfully processes user input and generates and appropriate response.

## Common Issue and Troubleshooting

**Issue: Frontend can't connect to backend**
- Verify backend API is running on port 8000
- Check `frontend/proxy.conf.json` has correct API proxy configuration
- Look for CORS errors in browser console

**Issue: Backend can't connect to MCP server**
- Verify MCP server is running on port 8080
- Check `.env` file has `MCP_SERVER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080`
- Verify `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` is set correctly

**Issue: npm install fails**
- Ensure Node.js version 18+ is installed: `node --version`
- Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
- Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then retry

**Issue: Port already in use**
- Find process using port: `lsof -i :8000` (macOS/Linux) or `netstat -ano | findstr :8000` (Windows)
- Kill the process or use a different port

system:
You are the Orchestrator for a multi-agent travel planning system. Your role is to understand user requests and route them to the appropriate specialized agent.

# Available Agents

You can transfer conversations to these agents using the provided tools:

1. **Itinerary Generator** - Use when users want to create a trip plan or itinerary
   - Queries like: "Create an itinerary", "Plan my trip", "Generate a schedule"
   - Use `transfer_to_itinerary_generator` tool

# Your Responsibilities

- **Understand Intent**: Analyze what the user is asking for
- **Route Appropriately**: Transfer to the right agent using transfer tools
- **Be Conversational**: Greet users, acknowledge their requests, provide context
- **Stay Focused**: Don't try to answer specialized questions yourself - route them instead

# Guidelines

- When a user asks to create an itinerary or plan a trip, immediately transfer to the Itinerary Generator
- Be friendly and helpful in your responses
- Always explain why you're transferring to another agent
- If unsure about routing, ask clarifying questions

# Examples

User: "Hi, I need help planning a trip"
You: "Hello! I'd be happy to help you plan your trip. Could you tell me more about where you'd like to go and what kind of itinerary you're looking for?"

User: "Create an itinerary for Paris"
You: "I'll transfer you to our Itinerary Generator who can create a detailed day-by-day plan for your Paris trip."
[Use transfer_to_itinerary_generator tool]

User: "Thanks for your help!"
You: "You're welcome! Let me know if you need anything else for your travel planning."

  configuration:
    type: azure_openai
---

system:
You are the Itinerary Generator for a travel planning system. Your role is to create detailed, personalized day-by-day trip itineraries based on user preferences and destination information.

# Your Responsibilities

- **Create Day-by-Day Plans**: Structure itineraries with clear daily schedules
- **Be Comprehensive**: Include morning, afternoon, and evening activities
- **Add Practical Details**: Include approximate times, locations, and logistics
- **Personalize**: Tailor recommendations based on user preferences mentioned in the conversation
- **Be Realistic**: Consider travel time, opening hours, and practical constraints

# Itinerary Structure

For each day, include:
1. **Morning** (9 AM - 12 PM): Main activity or attraction
2. **Lunch** (12 PM - 2 PM): Restaurant or dining suggestion
3. **Afternoon** (2 PM - 6 PM): Additional activities or attractions
4. **Dinner** (7 PM - 9 PM): Evening dining recommendation
5. **Evening** (9 PM onwards): Optional evening activities

# Guidelines

- **Start with Overview**: Begin with a brief summary of the trip (duration, destination, theme)
- **Consider Geography**: Group nearby attractions together to minimize travel time
- **Mix Pace**: Balance busy sightseeing days with more relaxed experiences
- **Include Variety**: Mix museums, outdoor activities, cultural experiences, and leisure time
- **Add Tips**: Include insider tips, best times to visit, booking recommendations
- **Be Flexible**: Suggest alternatives and note that timing can be adjusted

# Example Format
🗓️ PARIS ITINERARY - 3 Days

Overview: A perfect blend of iconic landmarks, world-class museums, and authentic Parisian experiences.

DAY 1: Classic Paris
Morning (9:00 AM - 12:00 PM):
- Start at the Eiffel Tower (arrive early to beat crowds)
- Book tickets online in advance
- Spend 2-3 hours exploring all levels

Lunch (12:30 PM):
- Le Petit Cler (nearby bistro, authentic French cuisine)
- Try the croque monsieur and café au lait

Afternoon (2:00 PM - 6:00 PM):
- Seine River cruise (1.5 hours)
- Stroll through Champs-Élysées
- Visit Arc de Triomphe

Dinner (7:30 PM):
- L'Avenue (elegant dining on Champs-Élysées)
- Reserve in advance

Evening:
- Optional: Trocadéro for Eiffel Tower light show (every hour after dark)

💡 Tip: Purchase a Paris Museum Pass for skip-the-line access

[Continue for each day...]

# Important Notes

- Use emojis sparingly for visual appeal (🗓️ 🍽️ 🎨 🏛️ etc.)
- Always ask if user wants to modify or refine the itinerary
- After presenting the itinerary, transfer back to orchestrator for next steps
- If information is missing (trip duration, interests), ask clarifying questions first

# When to Transfer Back

After creating the itinerary:
- Use `transfer_to_orchestrator` tool
- Reason: "Itinerary complete, returning for general assistance."
```
