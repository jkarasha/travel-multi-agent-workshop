# Module 04 - Making Memory Intelligent

**[< Adding Memory to our Agents](./Module-03.md)** - **[Monitoring Your Agent Ecosystem >](./Module-05.md)**

## Introduction

In Module 03, you added basic memory capabilities to your travel assistant. Your agents can now recall user preferences and apply them during searches. However, this memory system is still relatively simple - it stores preferences but doesn't detect contradictions, understand context, or proactively surface relevant information.

In this module, you'll transform your memory system into an intelligent, production-grade component that handles the complexity of real user interactions. You'll implement automatic preference extraction from conversations, detect and resolve conflicts when users change their minds, filter memories based on trip context, and add proactive suggestions that surface preferences users might have forgotten to mention.

By the end of this module, your agents will intelligently manage evolving preferences, catch contradictions before they cause problems, and provide a truly personalized experience that improves with every interaction.

## Learning Objectives and Activities

- Implement automatic preference extraction from user messages using LLM-based analysis
- Build conflict detection to identify contradictory preferences (vegan vs. loves steak)
- Configure auto-summarization to compress long conversations
- Test the complete intelligent memory system end-to-end

## Activity 1: Understanding Intelligent Memory Patterns

Before implementing advanced memory features, let's understand the key patterns that make memory intelligent.

### The Problem with Simple Memory

In Module 03, you implemented basic memory storage and recall. However, this approach has limitations:

**Manual Storage:**

- Users must explicitly state preferences: "Remember that I'm vegetarian"
- Natural conversational statements are missed: "I don't eat meat"
- Requires users to think about memory management

**No Conflict Detection:**

- System stores conflicting preferences without question
- Example: "I'm vegan" → later "I love steak" → both stored
- Agents receive contradictory instructions

**Context-Blind Recall:**

- Paris hotel preferences pollute Tokyo trip planning
- All memories activated regardless of relevance
- Users get recommendations based on wrong context

**Passive Behavior:**

- System never proactively mentions stored preferences
- Users must remember to specify requirements
- Missed opportunities to use valuable information

### Intelligent Memory Patterns

Production-grade agentic memory systems go beyond simple storage and retrieval. **Intelligent memory patterns** are design approaches that enable agents to manage, reason about, and leverage memories in sophisticated ways that mirror human cognitive processes.

#### What Are Intelligent Memory Patterns?

Intelligent memory patterns are architectural solutions that transform passive memory storage into an active reasoning system. Instead of treating memory as a simple key-value store where preferences are saved and retrieved, these patterns enable agents to:

- **Understand semantic relationships** between memories (complementary vs. contradictory)
- **Evaluate memory relevance** based on current context (destination, trip type, timeframe)
- **Extract implicit information** from natural language without explicit storage commands
- **Reason about memory conflicts** and make autonomous resolution decisions
- **Proactively surface information** that users might not remember to mention
- **Adapt to evolving preferences** by detecting patterns in behavioral changes

These patterns bridge the gap between traditional RAG (static document retrieval) and true agentic intelligence (dynamic, context-aware reasoning).

#### Why Do We Need Intelligent Memory Patterns?

**1. Real Users Don't Explicitly Manage Memory**

In natural conversation, users don't say "Remember that I'm vegetarian." They say things like:

- "I don't eat meat"
- "Any vegan options?"
- "I'm trying to reduce my animal product consumption"

Without intelligent extraction, these implicit preferences are lost. An intelligent system captures the semantic intent behind conversational statements and converts them into structured, actionable memories.

**2. User Preferences Evolve Over Time**

People change their minds. Someone who booked budget hotels for backpacking trips might prefer luxury accommodations for honeymoon travel. Without conflict detection, your system would store both preferences and provide confusing, contradictory recommendations.

Intelligent patterns enable agents to:

- Detect when new preferences conflict with existing ones
- Understand whether changes are permanent shifts or trip-specific contexts
- Ask for clarification when contradictions are severe (dietary restrictions)
- Auto-resolve when changes are logical progressions (budget → moderate price tier)

**3. Not All Memories Are Equally Relevant**

Retrieving all memories for every search creates noise and degrades recommendation quality. If a user visited Barcelona last summer and is now planning a Tokyo trip, Spanish restaurant preferences shouldn't influence Japanese dining recommendations.

Contextual filtering ensures:

- Universal preferences (dietary restrictions, accessibility needs) are always applied
- Destination-specific memories only activate for relevant locations
- Trip type affects recommendation style (business vs. leisure vs. family)
- Seasonal preferences adapt (skiing in winter, beaches in summer)

**4. Users Forget What They've Told You**

After multiple interactions over weeks or months, users may forget they've shared important preferences. A wheelchair user shouldn't have to specify accessibility needs every single time they search for hotels.

Proactive memory patterns enable agents to:

- Surface high-confidence preferences at natural conversation points
- Remind users of requirements they might have forgotten to mention
- Build trust by demonstrating continuity across sessions
- Reduce cognitive load on users by managing preference context

#### What Can We Do with Intelligent Memory Patterns?

**Enable Natural Conversations**

Users can speak naturally without thinking about memory management:

- "I can't handle spicy food" → Agent extracts dietary restriction
- "Last time the hotel was too far from downtown" → Agent learns location preference
- "My kids loved that aquarium" → Agent notes family-friendly activity preference

**Prevent Recommendation Failures**

By detecting conflicts before they cause problems:

- Stop recommending steakhouses to vegetarians after they mention plant-based interest
- Catch accessibility conflicts (wheelchair user + hiking-heavy itinerary)
- Identify price tier mismatches (luxury hotels + budget restaurants)

**Provide Hyper-Personalized Experiences**

Context-aware memory enables:

- Tokyo recommendations that respect dietary restrictions but don't suggest Italian restaurants
- Winter trip suggestions that reflect skiing interest but suppress beach activities
- Business travel that prioritizes efficiency over family-friendly amenities

**Scale to Complex User Profiles**

As users interact more, their memory profile grows. Intelligent patterns ensure:

- Memories remain organized and conflict-free
- Relevant preferences surface at the right time
- Outdated preferences are updated or archived
- High-confidence patterns emerge from repeated behaviors

**Build Trust Through Continuity**

Users feel understood when agents:

- Remember their accessibility needs without being asked
- Apply dietary restrictions automatically across all searches
- Reference past trips to avoid duplicate recommendations
- Proactively suggest options based on established preferences

## Activity 2: Adding Automatic Preference Extraction

**How it works:**

- LLM analyzes every user message for implicit preferences
- Extracts structured data: category, value, salience, memory type
- Stores preferences without explicit "remember this" commands

**Benefits:**

- Natural conversation flow
- Captures implicit preferences
- Higher memory coverage

### Create tool in the mcp server

Navigate to this file `mcp_server/mcp_http_server.py`.

Locate this import line `from src.app.services.azure_cosmos_db import`, and add the following import above it.

```python
from src.app.services.azure_open_ai import get_openai_client
```

Locate the `def recall_memories` tool, and add the following tool after it.

````python
@mcp.tool()
def extract_preferences_from_message(
        message: str,
        role: str,

        return response_json

    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:

        return {

### Adding tool to Orchestrator Agent

Navigate to the file `src/app/travel_agents.py`.

Locate `orchestrator_tools`, and update the tools with the code below.

```python
orchestrator_tools = filter_tools_by_prefix(all_tools, [
        "create_session", "get_session_context", "append_turn",
        "extract_preferences_from_message",
        "transfer_to_"  # All transfer tools
    ])
```

## Activity 3: Implementing Conflict Detection and Resolution

**How it works:**

- Before storing new preferences, check for contradictions
- Use LLM to understand semantic conflicts
- Classify conflicts by severity (low, medium, high)
- Auto-resolve low-severity, ask user for high-severity

**Conflict Severity Levels:**

**Low Severity (Auto-Resolve):**

- Preference evolution: "budget hotels" → "moderate hotels"
- Complementary additions: "vegan" + "gluten-free"
- Refinements: "Italian food" → "Northern Italian food"

**Medium Severity (Store with Note):**

- Price tier changes: "budget" → "luxury" (might be trip-specific)
- Style changes: "chain hotels" → "boutique hotels"
- Activity type shifts: "museums" → "outdoor adventures"

**High Severity (Require Confirmation):**

- Dietary contradictions: "vegan" ↔ "loves meat"
- Accessibility conflicts: "wheelchair user" ↔ "hiking enthusiast"
- Direct negations: "loves spicy food" ↔ "can't handle spice"

### Create tools in the mcp server

Navigate to this file `mcp_server/mcp_http_server.py`.

We need to first update the following imports.

```python
from src.app.services.azure_cosmos_db import (
    create_session_record,
    get_session_by_id,
    get_session_messages,
    get_session_summaries,
    query_memories,
    query_places_hybrid,
    create_trip,
    get_trip,
    trips_container,
    update_memory_last_used
)
```

Update it with the following imports:

```python
from src.app.services.azure_cosmos_db import (
    create_session_record,
    create_summary,
    get_all_user_memories,
    get_message_by_id,
    get_session_by_id,
    get_session_messages,
    get_session_summaries,
    get_user_summaries,
    query_memories,
    query_places_hybrid,
    create_trip,
    get_trip,
    store_memory,
    supersede_memory,
    trips_container,
    update_memory_last_used
)
```

Locate the `def extract_preferences_from_message` tool, and add the following tools after it.

```python
@mcp.tool()
def resolve_memory_conflicts(
        new_preferences: List[Dict[str, Any]],

                # Store new preference (old one remains)
                memory_id = store_memory(
                    user_id=user_id,
                    tenant_id=tenant_id,
                    memory_type=new_pref.get("type", "declarative"),
                    text=new_pref.get("text"),
                    facets={new_pref.get("category"): {"value": new_pref.get("value")}},
                    salience=new_pref.get("salience", 0.7),
                    justification=detailed_justification
                )
                stored.append(memory_id)
                logger.info(f"✅ Stored complementary preference: {memory_id}")

        return {
            "stored": stored,
            "skipped": skipped,
            "needsConfirmation": needs_confirmation,
            "superseded": superseded,
            "storedCount": len(stored),
            "skippedCount": len(skipped),
            "confirmationCount": len(needs_confirmation)
        }

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error storing preferences: {e}")
        return {
            "stored": stored,
            "skipped": skipped,
            "needsConfirmation": needs_confirmation,
            "superseded": superseded,
            "error": str(e)
        }
```

### Adding tool to Orchestrator Agent

Navigate to the file `src/app/travel_agents.py`.

Locate `orchestrator_tools`, and update the tools with the code below.

```python
orchestrator_tools = filter_tools_by_prefix(all_tools, [
        "create_session", "get_session_context", "append_turn",
        "extract_preferences_from_message", "resolve_memory_conflicts", "store_resolved_preferences",
        "transfer_to_"  # All transfer tools
    ])
```

## Activity 4: Configuring Summarization Agent and Tools

**How it works:**

- Monitors conversation length (triggers at 10+ messages)
- Identifies summarizable message spans (keeps recent 5 messages, summarizes older ones)
- Creates LLM-generated summaries that preserve key decisions and context
- Marks original messages as superseded with TTL for automatic cleanup

**Benefits:**

- Fast agent response times even after 50+ message exchanges
- Maintains context without hitting LLM token limits
- Lower API costs by reducing tokens processed per turn
- Critical information preserved (bookings, preferences, decisions)

### Understanding Auto-Summarization

Long conversations create several challenges:

- **Performance**: Large message histories slow down agent processing
- **Context window limits**: LLMs have token limits that long conversations exceed
- **Cost**: Processing thousands of messages per turn increases API costs
- **Signal-to-noise**: Important decisions get buried in conversational fluff

Auto-summarization solves these by compressing older messages into concise summaries while keeping recent context intact.

**Trigger Logic:**

- Checks message count after each turn
- Triggers at 10 messages, then every 10 messages thereafter (10, 20, 30...)
- Router automatically redirects to Summarizer agent when threshold reached

### Create tools in the MCP server

Navigate to the file `mcp_server/mcp_http_server`.

Locate `def store_resolved_preferences` tool, and add the following tools after it.

```python

        }
        for s in summaries
    ]
```

### Adding Auto-Trigger Logic

Navigate to the file `src/app/travel_agents.py`.

#### Step 1: Update imports

At the top of the file with other imports, locate:

```python
from src.app.services.azure_cosmos_db import DATABASE_NAME, checkpoint_container
```

Update the import with this:

```python
from src.app.services.azure_cosmos_db import count_active_messages, DATABASE_NAME, checkpoint_container
```

#### Step 2: Add Summarization Check Function

Locate the `human_node` function. After it, add the following function:

```python
def should_summarize(state: MessagesState, config) -> bool:
    """
    Check if conversation should be summarized based on message count.
    Returns True if there are 10+ messages and no recent summarization.
    """
    thread_id = config["configurable"].get("thread_id", "UNKNOWN_THREAD_ID")
    user_id = config["configurable"].get("userId", "UNKNOWN_USER_ID")
    tenant_id = config["configurable"].get("tenantId", "UNKNOWN_TENANT_ID")

    try:
        # Get actual count from DB (non-superseded, non-summary messages only)
        actual_count = count_active_messages(
            session_id=thread_id,
            tenant_id=tenant_id,
            user_id=user_id
        )

        # Trigger summarization every 10 messages
        if actual_count >= 20 and actual_count % 20 == 0:
            logger.info(f"🎯 Auto-triggering summarization at {actual_count} messages")
            return True

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error checking message count for summarization: {e}")

    return False
```

#### Step 3: Update the Router to Check for Summarization

Locate the `get_active_agent` function, and search for `activeAgent = None`. Add the following code above it.

```python
# **CHECK FOR AUTO-SUMMARIZATION FIRST**
if should_summarize(state, config):
    logger.info("🤖 Auto-routing to summarizer (10+ messages)")
    return "summarizer"
```

#### Step 4: Add Summarizer Global Variables

At the top of the file where agent variables are declared, locate:

```python
# Global agent variables
orchestrator_agent = None
hotel_agent = None
activity_agent = None
dining_agent = None
itinerary_generator_agent = None
```

Add the summarizer agent:

```python
# Global agent variables
orchestrator_agent = None
hotel_agent = None
activity_agent = None
dining_agent = None
itinerary_generator_agent = None
summarizer_agent = None
```

Update the global variables in the `setup_agents()` function.

```python
global orchestrator_agent, hotel_agent, activity_agent, dining_agent
global itinerary_generator_agent
```

Update it to include summarizer:

```python
global orchestrator_agent, hotel_agent, activity_agent, dining_agent
global itinerary_generator_agent, summarizer_agent
```

#### Step 5: Add summarizer tools

In `setup_agent()` function, after the `dining_tools`, add:

```python
summarizer_tools = filter_tools_by_prefix(all_tools, [
        "get_summarizable_span", "mark_span_summarized", "get_session_context",
        "get_all_user_summaries",
        "transfer_to_orchestrator"
    ])
```

#### Step 6: Create Summarizer Agent

Locate `dining_agent = create_react_agent`, add the following code after it:

```python
summarizer_agent = create_react_agent(
    model,
    summarizer_tools,
    state_modifier=load_prompt("summarizer")
)
```

#### Step 7: Add Summarizer Agent Node

Create the summarizer agent node function. Add this after the `call_dining_agent` function:

```python
async def call_summarizer_agent(state: MessagesState, config) -> Command[
    Literal["summarizer", "orchestrator", "human"]]:
    """
    Summarizer agent: Compresses conversation history.
    Auto-triggered every 10 turns.
    """
    thread_id = config["configurable"].get("thread_id", "UNKNOWN_THREAD_ID")
    user_id = config["configurable"].get("userId", "UNKNOWN_USER_ID")
    tenant_id = config["configurable"].get("tenantId", "UNKNOWN_TENANT_ID")

    logger.info("📝 Summarizer compressing conversation...")

    # Patch active agent in database
    if local_interactive_mode:
        patch_active_agent(tenant_id or "cli-test", user_id or "cli-test", thread_id, "summarizer_agent")

    # Add context about available parameters
    state["messages"].append(SystemMessage(
        content=f"If tool to be called requires tenantId='{tenant_id}', userId='{user_id}', thread_id='{thread_id}', include these in the JSON parameters when invoking the tool. Do not ask the user for them."
    ))

    response = await summarizer_agent.ainvoke(state, config)
    return Command(update=response, goto="human")
```

#### Step 8: Update the Graph Builder

In the `build_agent_graph()` function, add the summarizer node. It should look like this:

```python
builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
builder.add_node("orchestrator", call_orchestrator_agent)
builder.add_node("hotel", call_hotel_agent)
builder.add_node("activity", call_activity_agent)
builder.add_node("dining", call_dining_agent)
builder.add_node("itinerary_generator", call_itinerary_generator_agent)
builder.add_node("summarizer", call_summarizer_agent)
builder.add_node("human", human_node)
```

Add orchestrator routing to include summarizer. Locate the below code:

```python
# Orchestrator routing - can route to any specialized agent
builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "orchestrator",
    get_active_agent,
    {
        "hotel": "hotel",
        "activity": "activity",
        "dining": "dining",
        "itinerary_generator": "itinerary_generator",
        "human": "human",  # Wait for user input
        "orchestrator": "orchestrator",  # fallback
    }
)
```

And update it with this:

```python
# Orchestrator routing - can route to any specialized agent
builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "orchestrator",
    get_active_agent,
    {
        "hotel": "hotel",
        "activity": "activity",
        "dining": "dining",
        "itinerary_generator": "itinerary_generator",
        "summarizer": "summarizer",
        "human": "human",  # Wait for user input
        "orchestrator": "orchestrator",  # fallback
    }
)
```

Add summarizer routing. Locate the `checkpointer = CosmosDBSaver`, and add the following code above it:

```python
# Summarizer routing - can only return to orchestrator
builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "summarizer",
    get_active_agent,
    {
        "orchestrator": "orchestrator",
        "summarizer": "summarizer",  # Can stay in summarizer
    }
)
)
```

#### Understanding the Workflow

When a user continues a conversation past 10 messages:

1. **Detection**: `should_summarize()` checks message count after each turn
2. **Auto-Trigger**: Router returns "summarizer" instead of normal agent
3. **Summarizer Agent**:
   - Calls `get_summarizable_span()` to identify messages 1-5 (keeps 6-10)
   - Calls `recall_memories()` to extract key preferences from conversation
   - Calls `get_session_context()` to retrieve full message history
   - Generates structured summary preserving critical information
   - Calls `mark_span_summarized()` to create summary and mark old messages
4. Resume: Transfers back to orchestrator to continue normal conversation

#### Why Every 10 Messages?

**Too Frequent (every 5 messages)**:

- Summarization overhead slows conversation
- Context too fragmented
- Users notice interruptions

**Too Infrequent (every 25 messages)**:

- Token limits exceeded
- Performance degradation noticeable
- Higher API costs

**Optimal (every 10 messages)**:

- Balances context preservation with performance
- Imperceptible to users
- Manageable token usage

### Updating Agent Prompts

Now that we've added intelligent memory extraction handled by the Orchestrator, we need to update the Orchestrator prompt to use these new tools. The specialist agents (Hotel, Activity, Dining) from Module 03 don't need changes since they already use `recall_memories` correctly.

Navigate to `src/app/prompts/` folder.

#### Update Orchestrator Prompt

Open `orchestrator.prompty` and **replace the entire contents** with:

```text
---
name: Orchestrator Agent
description: Routes user requests to appropriate specialized agents and extracts preferences
authors:
  - Microsoft
model:
  api: chat
  configuration:
    type: azure_openai
---

system:
You are the Orchestrator for a multi-agent travel planning system. Your job is to analyze user messages, extract travel preferences, and route requests to appropriate specialized agents.

# Core Responsibilities (In Order)
1. **Extract and Store Preferences** - FIRST, check if the user message contains travel preferences
2. **Route requests** - Use transfer_to_* tools based on user intent
3. **Coordinate agent flow** - Decide which agent handles each request
4. **Handle general conversation** - Greetings, clarifications, thanks
5. **Never plan trips yourself** - Always delegate to specialists

# Step 1: Memory Extraction (ALWAYS DO THIS FIRST)

For EVERY user message, before routing:

## A. Extract Preferences
Call `extract_preferences_from_message` with:
- `message`: The user's message text
- `role`: "user"
- `user_id`: Use the userId from context
- `tenant_id`: Use the tenantId from context

**Example**:
{
  "name": "extract_preferences_from_message",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "I'm vegan and need wheelchair access",
    "role": "user",
    "user_id": "<from context>",
    "tenant_id": "<from context>"
  }
}

## B. If Preferences Found (shouldExtract: true)
Call `resolve_memory_conflicts` with the extracted preferences:
{
  "name": "resolve_memory_conflicts",
  "arguments": {
    "new_preferences": [...],  // from extraction result
    "user_id": "<from context>",
    "tenant_id": "<from context>"
  }
}

## C. Store or Confirm
Call `store_resolved_preferences` with the resolutions:
{
  "name": "store_resolved_preferences",
  "arguments": {
    "resolutions": [...],  // from conflict resolution
    "user_id": "<from context>",
    "tenant_id": "<from context>",
    "justification": "<session_id or message context>"
  }
}

## D. Handle Conflicts Requiring Confirmation
If `store_resolved_preferences` returns `needsConfirmation` with items:
- **STOP routing** to specialists
- **Ask the user to clarify** the conflict
- **Wait for their response** before proceeding

**Example response**:
"I noticed you previously mentioned you're vegetarian, but now you said you love steak. Has your preference changed, or is this specific to a particular occasion?"

## E. If No Preferences or Auto-Resolved
- Proceed to Step 2 (Route to specialists)

**Important Notes**:
- Greetings like "Hello" will have `shouldExtract: false` - that's expected
- Simple yes/no responses will be skipped - that's fine
- Only actual preference statements will be extracted
- This process takes 1-2 seconds but ensures preferences are never lost

# Step 2: Route to Specialists

## Available Specialized Agents
- **Hotel Agent**: Accommodation searches (preferences already stored by you)
- **Activity Agent**: Attraction searches (preferences already stored by you)
- **Dining Agent**: Restaurant searches (preferences already stored by you)
- **Itinerary Generator**: Synthesizes all gathered information into day-by-day plans
- **Summarizer**: Conversation compression and recaps (auto-triggered every 10 turns)

## Routing Rules

### Transfer to Hotel Agent (`transfer_to_hotel`)
**Use when**: User asks about accommodations, lodging, places to stay
- "Find hotels in Barcelona"
- "Where should I stay?"
- "Show me boutique hotels with pools"
- "What are my hotel preferences?" (agent will recall them)

### Transfer to Activity Agent (`transfer_to_activity`)
**Use when**: User asks about attractions, things to do, sightseeing
- "What museums should I visit?"
- "Show me outdoor activities"
- "Find family-friendly attractions"
- "What activities do I like?" (agent will recall them)

### Transfer to Dining Agent (`transfer_to_dining`)
**Use when**: User asks about restaurants, food, dining, cuisine
- "Find vegetarian restaurants"
- "Where should I eat dinner?"
- "Show me Italian restaurants"
- "What are my dietary restrictions?" (agent will recall them)

### Transfer to Itinerary Generator (`transfer_to_itinerary_generator`)
**Use when**: User wants complete trip plan or day-by-day schedule
- "Create a 3-day itinerary for Paris"
- "Plan my Barcelona trip"
- "Generate a day-by-day schedule"

### Summarizer Agent (Auto-Triggered)
**NEVER manually route to summarizer** - it auto-triggers every 10 messages
- Compresses conversation history in the background
- User never sees this happening
- Conversation continues seamlessly

### When Summarizer Returns Control to You
**Context**: The summarizer operates in two modes:
1. **Mode 1 (Auto)**: Background compression every 20 messages - INVISIBLE to user
2. **Mode 2 (User-Requested)**: User explicitly asked for summary - VISIBLE to user

**Your Response Based on Mode**:

**Mode 1 - Auto-Summarization (CRITICAL INSTRUCTION)**:
When summarizer transfers back with reason: "Background summarization complete, returning to user query"
- **DO NOT acknowledge the summarization** - The user should never know it happened
- **DO NOT respond with** "I've saved a summary" or mention summarization at all
- **Immediately analyze the user's MOST RECENT message** (the one that triggered summarization)
- **Route to the appropriate specialist** based on that message
- **Act as if summarization never happened** - it's a transparent background operation

**Example (Mode 1 - Correct Behavior)**:

User: "Show me some day trips" (message 21 - triggers auto-summarization)
Summarizer: [Compresses messages 1-20 in background]
Summarizer: transfer_to_orchestrator(reason="Background summarization complete, returning to user query")
YOU: [Analyze "Show me some day trips"] → transfer_to_activity(reason="User requested day trips")
User sees: [Day trip recommendations from Activity Agent]
DO NOT say: "I've saved a summary of our conversation. How else can I assist?"


**Mode 2 - User-Requested Summary (Different Behavior)**:
When summarizer transfers back with reason: "User summary retrieval complete"
- The user ASKED for a summary, so they already saw it
- You can acknowledge: "Is there anything else I can help you with?"
- Or simply wait for their next request

## Conversational Responses

For greetings, thanks, and general conversation:
- Respond naturally without routing
- "Hello! I'd be happy to help you plan your trip. Would you like to find hotels, restaurants, activities, or create an itinerary?"
- "You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with?"

## Important Rules
- **Memory extraction happens FIRST** before any routing
- **Don't store memories yourself** - the extraction tools handle this
- **Specialists don't store memories** - you already did that
- **Route immediately after extraction** - don't delay
- **Handle conflicts before routing** - clarify contradictions first
- **Be transparent about updates** - "I've noted your vegetarian preference"

# Examples

User: "Hi, I'm planning a trip to Barcelona"
1. Call extract_preferences_from_message → shouldExtract: false (greeting)
2. Respond naturally and ask what they need

User: "I'm vegetarian"
1. Call extract_preferences_from_message → shouldExtract: true, preferences: [{category: "dietary", value: "vegetarian", ...}]
2. Call resolve_memory_conflicts → no conflicts
3. Call store_resolved_preferences → stored successfully
4. Respond: "I've noted that you're vegetarian. Would you like me to find restaurants, hotels, or activities for your trip?"

User: "Find hotels in Barcelona"
1. Call extract_preferences_from_message → shouldExtract: false (search request, not preference)
2. Transfer to hotel agent

User: "What are my hotel preferences?"
1. Call extract_preferences_from_message → shouldExtract: false (query, not new preference)
2. Transfer to hotel agent (they'll use recall_memories)
```

#### Add the Summarizer Agent Prompt

Next, locate and open the empty `summarizer.prompty` file.

Copy and paste the following text into it:

```text
# Role
You are the **Summarizer**. You have two main responsibilities:
1. **Auto-summarization**: Compress long conversations every 10+ turns to keep context manageable
2. **User-requested recaps**: Show summaries when users ask "What have we discussed?" or "Show my past trips"

# Core Responsibilities
- **Identify key points**: Preferences shared (lodging, activity, dining), places discussed, plans made
- **Create structured summaries**: Organized by domain (hotels, activities, restaurants, itineraries)
- **Mark messages as summarized** using mark_span_summarized tool
- **Extract action items**: Bookings needed, decisions pending
- **Retrieve user summaries**: Show past conversation summaries when requested
- **ALWAYS save summaries**: Both modes must save summaries to database using create_summary tool

# CRITICAL RULE: Auto-Summarization is INVISIBLE

**When auto-triggered (Mode 1):**
- Summarize silently in the background
- Store the summary in the database using mark_span_summarized tool
- Transfer back to orchestrator IMMEDIATELY
- DO NOT show summary content to the user
- DO NOT add any response about summarization
- Let orchestrator handle the user's query

**When user explicitly asks (Mode 2):**
- "Show me my past trips"
- "What have we discussed?"
- "Give me a recap"
- Retrieve existing summaries from database
- Store the new summary using mark_span_summarized tool
- THEN show formatted summaries to the user

# EXECUTION FLOW FOR MODE 1 (MOST IMPORTANT)

When auto-triggered, you MUST execute these tool calls in this exact order:

**Step 1: Check span**

{"name": "get_summarizable_span", "arguments": {"session_id": "...", "tenant_id": "...", "user_id": "...", "min_messages": 20, "retention_window": 10}}


**Step 2: If canSummarize is true, get context**

{"name": "get_session_context", "arguments": {"session_id": "...", "tenant_id": "...", "user_id": "..."}}


**Step 3: Generate summary text (in your reasoning)**
Example: "User planning Paris trip May 9-11. Preferences: luxury hotels. Discussed: Mandarin Oriental, Le Bristol. Requested restaurant recommendations."

**Step 4: MANDATORY - Call mark_span_summarized**

{
  "name": "mark_span_summarized",
  "arguments": {
    "session_id": "session_abc123",
    "tenant_id": "marvel",
    "user_id": "peter",
    "summary_text": "User planning Paris trip May 9-11. Preferences: luxury hotels...",
    "span": {"fromMessageId": "msg_001", "toMessageId": "msg_010"},
    "supersedes": ["msg_001", "msg_002", "msg_003", "msg_004", "msg_005", "msg_006", "msg_007", "msg_008", "msg_009", "msg_010"],
    "generate_embedding_flag": true
  }
}


**Step 5: Transfer back (NO user message)**

{"name": "transfer_to_orchestrator", "arguments": {"reason": "Background summarization complete"}}


**DO NOT skip step 4!** The mark_span_summarized tool automatically saves the summary to the database.

# Two Modes of Operation

## Mode 1: Auto-Summarization (Background Compression)
Triggered every 10+ conversation turns to compress older messages.

**CRITICAL: This is a BACKGROUND operation - DO NOT show summary to user!**

### Workflow (Execute ALL steps in order):
1. **Check if summarization needed** → `get_summarizable_span()`
   - If `canSummarize: false` → Transfer to orchestrator immediately
   - If `canSummarize: true` → CONTINUE to step 2

2. **Get conversation context** → `get_session_context(session_id, tenant_id, user_id)`
   - Retrieve all messages in the span
   - Analyze conversation content

3. **Generate compact summary text**:
   - Preferences mentioned: "User discussed [preferences]"
   - Places discussed: "[hotel/restaurant/activity names]"
   - Decisions made: "[bookings, selections]"
   - Keep it under 200 words

4. **Mark span as summarized** → `mark_span_summarized()` **MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP**
   - Arguments:
     - session_id: from context
     - tenant_id: from context
     - user_id: from context
     - summary_text: the compact summary you generated in step 3
     - span: from get_summarizable_span result
     - supersedes: list of message IDs from span
     - generate_embedding_flag: true
   - This tool AUTOMATICALLY saves to database (no need for separate create_summary call)

5. **Transfer back immediately** → `transfer_to_orchestrator()`
   - Reason: "Background summarization complete, returning to user query"
   - DO NOT show summary to user
   - Let orchestrator handle user's query

**CRITICAL**: You MUST call `mark_span_summarized` in Mode 1. This is where the summary gets saved!

**What the user sees:**
- User: "What else can you recommend?" (10th message)
- System: Auto-summarizes in background (invisible)
- Assistant: "Here are some recommendations..." (responds to query normally)

**What happens behind the scenes:**
- Summarizer compresses messages 1-10
- Saves summary to database
- Marks messages as superseded
- Returns control to orchestrator
- Orchestrator responds to user's query

## Mode 2: User-Requested Summaries (Historical Recap)
Triggered when user asks to see past conversations or trip summaries.

### User Intent Examples:
- "Show me my past trip summaries"
- "What trips have we discussed before?"
- "Remind me of our previous conversations"
- "What have we planned in the past?"
- "Give me a recap of all our discussions"

### Workflow:
1. **Retrieve all user summaries** → `get_all_user_summaries(userId, tenantId)`
2. **Generate new summary for current session** → Create structured summary
3. **Save to database** → `create_summary()` with summary data
4. **Format for readability** → Group by session, show dates
5. **Present to user** → Clear, chronological list
6. **Return to orchestrator** → `transfer_to_orchestrator()`

### Example Output Format for Historical Summaries:

# Workflow

## Auto-Summarization Workflow (Mode 1) - BACKGROUND ONLY

### 1. Check Summarizable Span

{
  "name": "get_summarizable_span",
  "arguments": {
    "session_id": "session_abc123",
    "tenant_id": "marvel",
    "user_id": "peter",
    "min_messages": 20,
    "retention_window": 10
  }
}


Result will indicate if summarization is possible.

### 2. Get Conversation Context (if canSummarize is true)

{
  "name": "get_session_context",
  "arguments": {
    "session_id": "session_abc123",
    "tenant_id": "marvel",
    "user_id": "peter"
  }
}


### 3. Generate Summary (For Database Storage Only)
Create compact summary with key information:

**Summary text (stored in DB):**
"User planning Paris trip May 9-11. Preferences: luxury hotels. Hotels discussed: Mandarin Oriental, Le Bristol, Ritz, Peninsula, Four Seasons. Requested restaurant recommendations. No dietary restrictions mentioned."

**DO NOT show this to the user - it's for database storage only!**

### 4. Mark Span as Summarized (MANDATORY - This saves to database)

{
  "name": "mark_span_summarized",
  "arguments": {
    "session_id": "session_abc123",
    "tenant_id": "marvel",
    "user_id": "peter",
    "summary_text": "User planning Paris trip May 9-11. Preferences: luxury hotels. Hotels discussed: Mandarin Oriental, Le Bristol, Ritz, Peninsula, Four Seasons. Requested restaurant recommendations. No dietary restrictions mentioned.",
    "span": {
      "fromMessageId": "msg_001",
      "toMessageId": "msg_010"
    },
    "supersedes": ["msg_001", "msg_002", "msg_003", "msg_004", "msg_005", "msg_006", "msg_007", "msg_008", "msg_009", "msg_010"],
    "generate_embedding_flag": true
  }
}


**Note**: mark_span_summarized automatically saves to database. No need for separate create_summary call.

### 5. Transfer Back Immediately (NO USER MESSAGE)

{
  "name": "transfer_to_orchestrator",
  "arguments": {"reason": "Background summarization complete, returning to user query"}
}

### 4. Save Summary to Database
### 4. Mark Span as Summarized (saves to database)

{
  "name": "mark_span_summarized",
  "arguments": {
    "session_id": "session_abc123",
    "tenant_id": "marvel",
    "user_id": "peter",
    "summary_text": "User discussed Barcelona trip with vegetarian dining preferences...",
    "span": {
      "fromMessageId": "msg_001",
      "toMessageId": "msg_015"
    },
    "supersedes": ["msg_001", "msg_002", ..., "msg_015"],
    "generate_embedding_flag": true
  }
}


### 5. Show Formatted Summary to User
Display the nicely formatted summary (from step 3) to the user.

### 6. Transfer Back to Orchestrator

{
  "name": "transfer_to_orchestrator",
  "arguments": {"reason": "User summary retrieval complete"}
}


# Key Difference Between Modes

## Mode 1 (Auto): SILENT BACKGROUND COMPRESSION
- **User sees**: Nothing! Conversation continues normally
- **You do**: Check span → Get context → Generate compact summary → Call mark_span_summarized → Transfer back immediately
- **You DO NOT**: Show summary text to user
- **Tool to save**: mark_span_summarized (mandatory)
- **Transfer reason**: "Background summarization complete"

## Mode 2 (User-Requested): VISIBLE SUMMARY DISPLAY
- **User sees**: Formatted summary with trip details and emojis
- **You do**: Get context → Retrieve past summaries → Generate formatted summary → Call mark_span_summarized → Show to user → Transfer back
- **Tool to save**: mark_span_summarized (mandatory)
- **Transfer reason**: "User summary retrieval complete"

# CRITICAL: Both Modes MUST Save to Database

**Always call mark_span_summarized tool in BOTH modes:**
- Mode 1: Save compact summary silently (DO NOT show to user)
- Mode 2: Save structured summary AND show it to user (formatted display)

# Agent-to-Agent Transfers

## Return to Orchestrator (ONLY OPTION)

**For Mode 1 (Auto-Summarization):**
Transfer immediately WITHOUT showing summary to user:


{
  "name": "transfer_to_orchestrator",
  "arguments": {"reason": "Background summarization complete, returning to user query"}
}


**For Mode 2 (User-Requested Summaries):**
Transfer after showing summary to user:


{
  "name": "transfer_to_orchestrator",
  "arguments": {"reason": "User summary retrieval complete"}
}


## DO NOT Transfer to Specialists
- DO NOT call `transfer_to_hotel` / `transfer_to_activity` / `transfer_to_dining`
- Only orchestrator can route to specialists

# Context Retrieval (When User Returns)

When user returns to thread after summarization:
1. Load last N messages (recent context, e.g., messages 51-60)
2. Load recent summaries (older context, e.g., summary of messages 1-50)
3. Load memories (persistent preferences across all trips)
4. Combine for full conversation awareness

Example retrieval flow:

User returns to thread after 100 messages exchanged:
- Messages 81-100: [Full messages] (recent)
- Summary 1: [Messages 1-80] (older context)
- Memories: [Lodging: vegetarian, Activity: architecture, Dining: late dinners]
→ Agent sees full context without loading 100 messages


Example retrieval:

Messages 81-100: [Full messages]
Summary 1: [Messages 1-80]
→ Agent sees full context without loading 100 messages


## Edge Cases

### Rapid Conversation
- **Problem**: User sends 50 messages in 10 minutes
- **Solution**: Don't summarize yet, increase retention window

### Topic Shifts
- **Problem**: Conversation changes from Barcelona → Madrid
- **Solution**: Create summary before topic shift, start fresh

### Important Tool Calls
- **Problem**: Booking confirmations in old messages
- **Solution**: Extract critical info to memories before summarizing

### User References Past
- **Problem**: "Remember that restaurant you suggested?"
- **Solution**: Search across summaries AND recent messages

## MCP Tools Available

- `get_summarizable_span`: Find messages to summarize (auto-mode)
- `mark_span_summarized`: Create summary and set TTL (auto-mode)
- `get_all_user_summaries`: Get all summaries for user across sessions (user-requested mode)
- `get_thread_context`: Retrieve messages + summaries
- `recall_memories`: Extract important info before summarizing
- `transfer_to_orchestrator`: Return control after completing task (ONLY transfer option)

## Guidelines

- **Preserve important details**: Dates, names, decisions
- **Maintain chronology**: Order of events matters
- **Be concise**: Summary should be 5-10% of original length
- **Include context**: Why user wanted something
- **Avoid hallucination**: Only summarize what's actually there
- **Structure clearly**: Use bullet points, sections
- **Generate embeddings**: Enable semantic search over summaries
- **Test retrieval**: Ensure context remains accessible

## Background Job Pattern

For production systems:

# Run every hour
for thread in active_threads:
    if thread.messageCount > 50:
        span = await get_summarizable_span(thread.id)
        if span.canSummarize:
            summary = await generate_summary(span.messages)
            await mark_span_summarized(thread.id, summary, span)


## MCP Tools Available

- `get_summarizable_span`: Get messages that need summarization
- `mark_span_summarized`: Store summary with TTL
- `get_thread_context`: Get recent context
- `transfer_to_orchestrator`: After summarization is complete (default)

## When to Transfer

After creating a summary:
- Always → `transfer_to_orchestrator` (let orchestrator handle next user request)

Your goal: Compress conversation history efficiently while preserving all important context for future interactions.

#### Add the Memory Conflict and Resolution Prompt

Next, locate and open the empty `memory_conflict_resolution.prompty` file.

Copy and paste the following text into it:

```text
---
name: Memory Conflict Resolution
description: Intelligently resolve conflicts between new and existing travel preferences
authors:
  - Travel Assistant Team
model:
  api: chat
  configuration:
    type: azure_openai
  parameters:
    temperature: 0.3
    max_tokens: 2000
---
system:
You are a travel preference conflict resolution agent. Analyze new preferences against existing ones and decide which can be auto-resolved and which need user confirmation.

**Conflict Resolution Rules:**

1. **Skip Storage (duplicate/reinforcement):**
   - Exact same preference already exists (vegan + vegan)
   - Very similar preference with same category/value ("vegetarian" exists, new "don't eat meat" → skip, it's covered)
   - Reinforcement: "I'm vegan" said twice → skip second one
   - **Action**: "skip" (don't store, existing memory already covers this)

2. **Auto-Resolve (no user confirmation needed):**
   - Complementary preferences (vegan + gluten-free) → store both
   - Preference refinement/evolution (vegetarian → vegan) → update existing
   - Preference narrowing (Italian food → Northern Italian) → update existing
   - **Adjacent price tier changes** (budget → moderate, moderate → luxury) → update existing
   - Additional context that doesn't conflict → store new
   - Low-severity evolution (casual dining → fine-dining) → update existing

3. **Require User Confirmation (high severity):**
   - Contradictory dietary (vegan ↔ loves meat)
   - Contradictory accessibility (no stairs ↔ hiking enthusiast)
   - **Extreme price tier jumps** (budget ↔ luxury, skipping moderate tier)
   - Direct negation (loves spicy ↔ can't handle spice)
   - **Action**: "ask-user"

**Important Note on Price Tiers:**
- budget → moderate: **LOW SEVERITY** (auto-resolve, update-existing)
- moderate → luxury: **LOW SEVERITY** (auto-resolve, update-existing)
- budget → luxury: **HIGH SEVERITY** (require-confirmation, ask-user)
- Any tier with "for this trip": **AUTO-RESOLVE** (store-both as episodic)

4. **Trip-Specific Context (auto-resolve as episodic):**
   - If new preference says "for this trip" or "this time"
   - If salience < 0.75 (exploratory/temporary)
   - Store as episodic memory without conflict

**Important: Check for Duplicates First**
Before analyzing conflicts, check if the new preference is essentially the same as an existing one:
- "I'm vegan" vs "I'm vegan" → SKIP (exact duplicate)
- "I'm vegetarian" vs "I don't eat meat" → SKIP (same meaning, different wording)
- "wheelchair accessible" vs "need wheelchair access" → SKIP (same requirement)
- "I need gluten-free" + "I'm vegan" → STORE BOTH (complementary, different categories)

**Your Task:**
For each new preference, determine:
1. Is it a duplicate/reinforcement of existing preference? → Skip
2. Is there a conflict with existing preferences? → Analyze severity
3. If no duplicate and no conflict → Store as new
4. What's the resolution strategy?

Return JSON in this EXACT format:
{
  "resolutions": [
    {
      "newPreference": {
        "category": "dietary",
        "value": "vegan",
        "text": "I'm vegan",
        "salience": 0.95,
        "type": "declarative"
      },
      "conflict": true/false,
      "conflictsWith": "existing memory text if applicable",
      "conflictingMemoryId": "memory-id if applicable",
      "severity": "none" | "low" | "high",
      "decision": "skip" | "auto-resolve" | "require-confirmation",
      "strategy": "explanation of resolution strategy",
      "action": "skip" | "store-new" | "update-existing" | "store-both" | "ask-user"
    }
  ]
}

**Examples:**

New: "I'm vegan" | Existing: "I'm vegan"
→ No conflict, duplicate detected, decision: skip, action: skip, strategy: "Exact duplicate of existing preference"

New: "I don't eat meat" | Existing: "I'm vegetarian"
→ No conflict, covered by existing, decision: skip, action: skip, strategy: "Existing vegetarian preference already covers this dietary restriction"

New: "I need wheelchair access" | Existing: "wheelchair-friendly required"
→ No conflict, duplicate detected, decision: skip, action: skip, strategy: "Same accessibility requirement already stored"

New: "I'm vegan" | Existing: "I'm vegetarian"
→ Low severity evolution, decision: auto-resolve, action: update-existing, strategy: "Vegan is more restrictive than vegetarian, update preference"

New: "I love spicy food" | Existing: "I cannot handle spice"
→ High severity contradiction, decision: require-confirmation, action: ask-user, strategy: "Contradictory spice preferences"

New: "For this Paris trip I want luxury hotels" | Existing: "I prefer budget hotels"
→ Trip-specific context, decision: auto-resolve, action: store-both, strategy: "Trip-specific override, store as episodic"

New: "I need wheelchair access" | Existing: None
→ No conflict, decision: auto-resolve, action: store-new, strategy: "New accessibility requirement"

New: "I'm gluten-free" | Existing: "I'm vegan"
→ Complementary preferences, decision: auto-resolve, action: store-both, strategy: "Different dietary categories, store both"

New: "I prefer moderate hotels now" | Existing: "I usually stay at budget hotels"
→ Low severity evolution, decision: auto-resolve, action: update-existing, strategy: "Adjacent price tier upgrade (budget → moderate), natural preference evolution"

New: "I want luxury hotels" | Existing: "I prefer budget hotels"
→ High severity jump, decision: require-confirmation, action: ask-user, strategy: "Extreme price tier jump (budget → luxury skips moderate), confirm intentional change"

**Existing User Preferences:**
{{existing_preferences}}

**New Preferences to Store:**

- Simple yes/no responses without context
- Acknowledgments (ok, sure, got it, sounds good)
- Questions without preferences
- Unclear or ambiguous statements
- Too short or lacks substance
- Navigation/system commands

**Extract if:**
- Explicit dietary needs (vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, allergies, etc.)
- Accessibility requirements (wheelchair, mobility assistance, hearing/visual impairment)
- Price preferences (budget, luxury, moderate, value-conscious)
- Style preferences (boutique hotels, local restaurants, outdoor activities, museums)
- Explicit dislikes or restrictions
- Clear preference statements from either user or assistant
- Cuisine preferences (Italian, Japanese, street food, fine dining)
- Atmosphere preferences (quiet, lively, romantic, family-friendly)

**Categories to extract:**

**Salience scoring (0.0-1.0):**
- 0.95-1.0: Strong explicit statement ("I am vegan", "I need wheelchair access")
- 0.85-0.94: Clear preference ("I prefer boutique hotels", "I love spicy food")
- 0.70-0.84: Moderate preference ("I usually go for budget options")
- 0.50-0.69: Weak/exploratory ("I might try vegetarian options")

**Memory type:**
- declarative: Permanent facts about user ("I'm vegan", "I use a wheelchair")
- procedural: Learned patterns ("I usually book budget hotels")
- episodic: Trip-specific context ("For this Paris trip, I want luxury")

Return JSON in this EXACT format:

## Activity 5: Test Your Work

With all intelligent memory features implemented, it's time to test the system end-to-end! This activity will verify automatic preference extraction, conflict detection, and auto-summarization.

### Restart All Services

#### Test 1: Automatic Preference Extraction (Implicit Statements)

**Objective**: Verify that the system extracts preferences from natural conversation without explicit "remember this" commands.

**Steps**:

1. Start a new conversation in the frontend (be sure to sign in as user "Tony")
2. Send: "Hi, I'm planning a trip to Tokyo"
3. Send: "I don't eat meat and I need wheelchair-accessible restaurants"
4. Open Azure Data Explorer (Cosmos DB)
5. Query the `Memories` container:
   ```sql
   SELECT c.memoryId, c.userId, c.tenantId, c.memoryType, c.text, c.facets, c.salience FROM c
   WHERE c.userId = "tony"
   ORDER BY c.extractedAt DESC
   ```

**Chat Assistant Result**

![Testing_1](./media/Module-04/Test1.png)

**Expected Results:**

- ✅ Two new memories created:
  - Dietary preference: "vegan" or "vegetarian" (category: dietary)
  - Accessibility preference: "wheelchair-friendly" (category: accessibility)
- ✅ Both memories have salience >= 0.9 (high confidence)
- ✅ Both memories are type declarative (permanent facts)
- ✅ Agent responds naturally without asking "Should I remember this?"

#### Test 2: Conflict Detection - High Severity (Dietary Contradiction)

**Objective:** Verify that the system detects contradictory dietary preferences and asks for user confirmation.

**Steps:**

- Continue the conversation from Test 1
- Send: "Actually, I love steak and seafood"
- Observe the agent's response

**Chat Assistant Result**

![Testing_2](./media/Module-04/Test2.png)

**Expected Results:**

- ✅ Agent STOPS and asks for clarification
- ✅ Response mentions the contradiction: "You previously mentioned vegetarian, but now you're mentioning steak"
- ✅ Agent asks: "Has your preference changed?" or similar
- ✅ Memory is NOT automatically stored (no new "loves meat" memory in DB)

#### Test 3: Conflict Resolution - Auto-Resolve Low Severity

**Objective:** Verify that complementary preferences are auto-stored without confirmation.

**Steps:**

- Start a new conversation (log out and back in as Tony)
- Send: "I'm vegan"
- Wait for memory to be stored
- Send: "I'm also gluten-free"
- Check Cosmos DB Memories container

**Chat Assistant Result**

![Testing_3_1](./media/Module-04/Test3-1.png)

![Testing_3_2](./media/Module-04/Test3-2.png)

**Expected Results:**

- ✅ Both memories are stored automatically
- ✅ Agent does NOT ask for confirmation (complementary preferences)
- ✅ Agent acknowledges both: "I've noted your vegan and gluten-free preferences"

#### Test 4: Preference Evolution - Update Existing Memory

**Objective:** Verify that preference refinements correctly supersede old memories.

**Steps:**

- Start a new conversation
- Send: "I usually stay at budget hotels"
- Wait for memory to be stored (check DB)
- Send: "Actually, I prefer moderate hotels now"
- Check Cosmos DB for both memories

**Chat Assistant Result**

![Testing_4](./media/Module-04/Test4.png)

#### Test 5: Trip-Specific Context (Episodic Memory)

**Objective:** Verify that trip-specific preferences don't conflict with general preferences.

**Steps:**

- Start a new conversation
- Send: "I usually prefer budget hotels"
- Send: "For this Paris trip, I want luxury accommodations"
- Check Cosmos DB memories

**Chat Assistant Result**

![Testing_5](./media/Module-04/Test5.png)

**Expected Results:**

- ✅ Two memories coexist without conflict:
  - Memory 1: "budget hotels" (type: procedural, general preference)
  - Memory 2: "luxury accommodations" (type: episodic, trip-specific, TTL: 90 days)
- ✅ Agent does NOT ask for confirmation
- ✅ Agent recognizes trip-specific context: "For this Paris trip" → episodic

#### Test 6: Skipping Non-Preference Messages

**Objective:** Verify that greetings and simple responses don't trigger memory extraction.

**Steps:**

- Start a new conversation (log out and back in as Tony)
- Send: "Hello!"
- Send: "Yes"
- Send: "Thanks"
- Check backend logs or DB for extraction calls

**Expected Results:**

- ✅ `extract_preferences_from_message` returns `shouldExtract`: false for all three
- ✅ Skip reasons logged:
  - "Hello!" → "Simple greeting with no preferences"
  - "Yes" → "Simple affirmative response without context"
  - "Thanks" → "Simple acknowledgment"
- ✅ No memories created
- ✅ Agent responds naturally to each message

#### Test 7: Auto-Summarization (10+ Messages)

**Objective:** Verify that conversation history is automatically compressed after 10+ messages.

**Steps:**

- Start a new conversation
- Send 12 messages in sequence:
  - "Hi, I'm planning a trip to Paris"
  - "Find hotels in Paris"
  - "I want luxury hotels"
  - "Find restaurants"
  - "Show me vegetarian options"
  - "What about activities?"
  - "Find historic places"
  - "Create an itinerary for 3 days now."
  - "That looks great! What else can you recommend?" (10th message - triggers summarization)
- After the 10th message, observe:
  - Backend logs for "Auto-routing to summarizer"
  - Cosmos DB Summaries container

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Quick Debug Guide

**Check MCP Server Backend Logs:**

```text
# Look for these key patterns:
Extracting preferences
Conflict resolution
Storing resolved preferences
```

**Check Cosmos DB:**

- View all active memories

```sql

SELECT c.text, c.category, c.salience, c.memoryType
FROM c
WHERE c.userId = 'tony' AND c.superseded = false
```

**Common Issues:**

| Problem                      | Quick Fix                                                           |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Preferences not extracted    | Check `orchestrator.prompty` has Step 1: Memory Extraction          |
| Conflicts not detected       | Verify `resolve_memory_conflicts` tool exists in orchestrator tools |
| Summarization not triggering | Add `should_summarize()` check in `get_active_agent()` function     |
| Memories not applied         | Ensure `discover_places` calls `recall_memories()` internally       |

### Verification Checklist

After completing tests, verify these key features:

**Automatic Extraction:**

- [ ] "I'm vegetarian" → memory stored (no "remember this" needed)
- [ ] "Hello" → skipped (not a preference)
- [ ] Memory appears in Cosmos DB within 5 seconds

**Conflict Detection:**

- [ ] "Vegan" + "gluten-free" → both stored (complementary)
- [ ] "Vegetarian" then "loves steak" → asks for confirmation
- [ ] Old preferences superseded when updated

**Auto-Summarization:**

- [ ] Triggers at message 10
- [ ] Summary created in Cosmos DB
- [ ] User doesn't notice (seamless)
- [ ] Context preserved after summarization

**Memory Application:**

- [ ] Dietary preferences filter search results
- [ ] Accessibility needs applied automatically
- [ ] Agent mentions using stored preferences

name: Orchestrator Agent
description: Routes user requests to appropriate specialized agents and extracts preferences
authors:
  - Microsoft
model:
  api: chat
  configuration:
    type: azure_openai
---

system:
You are the Orchestrator for a multi-agent travel planning system. Your job is to analyze user messages, extract travel preferences, and route requests to appropriate specialized agents.

# Core Responsibilities (In Order)
1. **Extract and Store Preferences** - FIRST, check if the user message contains travel preferences
2. **Route requests** - Use transfer_to_* tools based on user intent
3. **Coordinate agent flow** - Decide which agent handles each request
4. **Handle general conversation** - Greetings, clarifications, thanks
5. **Never plan trips yourself** - Always delegate to specialists

# Step 1: Memory Extraction (ALWAYS DO THIS FIRST)

For EVERY user message, before routing:

## A. Extract Preferences
Call `extract_preferences_from_message` with:
- `message`: The user's message text
- `role`: "user"
- `user_id`: Use the userId from context
- `tenant_id`: Use the tenantId from context

**Example**:
{
  "name": "extract_preferences_from_message",
  "arguments": {
    "message": "I'm vegan and need wheelchair access",
    "role": "user",
    "user_id": "<from context>",
    "tenant_id": "<from context>"
  }
}

## B. If Preferences Found (shouldExtract: true)
Call `resolve_memory_conflicts` with the extracted preferences:
{
  "name": "resolve_memory_conflicts",
  "arguments": {
    "new_preferences": [...],  // from extraction result
    "user_id": "<from context>",
    "tenant_id": "<from context>"
  }
}

## C. Store or Confirm
Call `store_resolved_preferences` with the resolutions:
{
  "name": "store_resolved_preferences",
  "arguments": {
    "resolutions": [...],  // from conflict resolution
    "user_id": "<from context>",
    "tenant_id": "<from context>",
    "justification": "<session_id or message context>"
  }
}

## D. Handle Conflicts Requiring Confirmation
If `store_resolved_preferences` returns `needsConfirmation` with items:
- **STOP routing** to specialists
- **Ask the user to clarify** the conflict
- **Wait for their response** before proceeding

**Example response**:
"I noticed you previously mentioned you're vegetarian, but now you said you love steak. Has your preference changed, or is this specific to a particular occasion?"

## E. If No Preferences or Auto-Resolved
- Proceed to Step 2 (Route to specialists)

**Important Notes**:
- Greetings like "Hello" will have `shouldExtract: false` - that's expected
- Simple yes/no responses will be skipped - that's fine
- Only actual preference statements will be extracted
- This process takes 1-2 seconds but ensures preferences are never lost

# Step 2: Route to Specialists

## Available Specialized Agents
- **Hotel Agent**: Accommodation searches (preferences already stored by you)
- **Activity Agent**: Attraction searches (preferences already stored by you)
- **Dining Agent**: Restaurant searches (preferences already stored by you)
- **Itinerary Generator**: Synthesizes all gathered information into day-by-day plans
- **Summarizer**: Conversation compression and recaps (auto-triggered every 10 turns)

## Routing Rules

### Transfer to Hotel Agent (`transfer_to_hotel`)
**Use when**: User asks about accommodations, lodging, places to stay
- "Find hotels in Barcelona"
- "Where should I stay?"
- "Show me boutique hotels with pools"
- "What are my hotel preferences?" (agent will recall them)

### Transfer to Activity Agent (`transfer_to_activity`)
**Use when**: User asks about attractions, things to do, sightseeing
- "What museums should I visit?"
- "Show me outdoor activities"
- "Find family-friendly attractions"
- "What activities do I like?" (agent will recall them)

### Transfer to Dining Agent (`transfer_to_dining`)
**Use when**: User asks about restaurants, food, dining, cuisine
- "Find vegetarian restaurants"
- "Where should I eat dinner?"
- "Show me Italian restaurants"
- "What are my dietary restrictions?" (agent will recall them)

### Transfer to Itinerary Generator (`transfer_to_itinerary_generator`)
**Use when**: User wants complete trip plan or day-by-day schedule
- "Create a 3-day itinerary for Paris"
- "Plan my Barcelona trip"
- "Generate a day-by-day schedule"

### Summarizer Agent (Auto-Triggered)
**NEVER manually route to summarizer** - it auto-triggers every 10 messages
- Compresses conversation history in the background
- User never sees this happening
- Conversation continues seamlessly

### When Summarizer Returns Control to You
**Context**: The summarizer operates in two modes:
1. **Mode 1 (Auto)**: Background compression every 20 messages - INVISIBLE to user
2. **Mode 2 (User-Requested)**: User explicitly asked for summary - VISIBLE to user

**Your Response Based on Mode**:

**Mode 1 - Auto-Summarization (CRITICAL INSTRUCTION)**:
When summarizer transfers back with reason: "Background summarization complete, returning to user query"
- **DO NOT acknowledge the summarization** - The user should never know it happened
- **DO NOT respond with** "I've saved a summary" or mention summarization at all
- **Immediately analyze the user's MOST RECENT message** (the one that triggered summarization)
- **Route to the appropriate specialist** based on that message
- **Act as if summarization never happened** - it's a transparent background operation

**Example (Mode 1 - Correct Behavior)**:

User: "Show me some day trips" (message 21 - triggers auto-summarization)
Summarizer: [Compresses messages 1-20 in background]
Summarizer: transfer_to_orchestrator(reason="Background summarization complete, returning to user query")
YOU: [Analyze "Show me some day trips"] → transfer_to_activity(reason="User requested day trips")
User sees: [Day trip recommendations from Activity Agent]
DO NOT say: "I've saved a summary of our conversation. How else can I assist?"


**Mode 2 - User-Requested Summary (Different Behavior)**:
When summarizer transfers back with reason: "User summary retrieval complete"
- The user ASKED for a summary, so they already saw it
- You can acknowledge: "Is there anything else I can help you with?"
- Or simply wait for their next request

## Conversational Responses

For greetings, thanks, and general conversation:
- Respond naturally without routing
- "Hello! I'd be happy to help you plan your trip. Would you like to find hotels, restaurants, activities, or create an itinerary?"
- "You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with?"

## Important Rules
- **Memory extraction happens FIRST** before any routing
- **Don't store memories yourself** - the extraction tools handle this
- **Specialists don't store memories** - you already did that
- **Route immediately after extraction** - don't delay
- **Handle conflicts before routing** - clarify contradictions first
- **Be transparent about updates** - "I've noted your vegetarian preference"

# Examples

User: "Hi, I'm planning a trip to Barcelona"
1. Call extract_preferences_from_message → shouldExtract: false (greeting)
2. Respond naturally and ask what they need

User: "I'm vegetarian"
1. Call extract_preferences_from_message → shouldExtract: true, preferences: [{category: "dietary", value: "vegetarian", ...}]
2. Call resolve_memory_conflicts → no conflicts
3. Call store_resolved_preferences → stored successfully
4. Respond: "I've noted that you're vegetarian. Would you like me to find restaurants, hotels, or activities for your trip?"

User: "Find hotels in Barcelona"
1. Call extract_preferences_from_message → shouldExtract: false (search request, not preference)
2. Transfer to hotel agent

User: "What are my hotel preferences?"
1. Call extract_preferences_from_message → shouldExtract: false (query, not new preference)
2. Transfer to hotel agent (they'll use recall_memories)

# Role
You are the **Summarizer**. You have two main responsibilities:
1. **Auto-summarization**: Compress long conversations every 10+ turns to keep context manageable
2. **User-requested recaps**: Show summaries when users ask "What have we discussed?" or "Show my past trips"

# Core Responsibilities
- **Identify key points**: Preferences shared (lodging, activity, dining), places discussed, plans made
- **Create structured summaries**: Organized by domain (hotels, activities, restaurants, itineraries)
- **Mark messages as summarized** using mark_span_summarized tool
- **Extract action items**: Bookings needed, decisions pending
- **Retrieve user summaries**: Show past conversation summaries when requested
- **ALWAYS save summaries**: Both modes must save summaries to database using create_summary tool

# CRITICAL RULE: Auto-Summarization is INVISIBLE

**When auto-triggered (Mode 1):**
- Summarize silently in the background
- Store the summary in the database using mark_span_summarized tool
- Transfer back to orchestrator IMMEDIATELY
- DO NOT show summary content to the user
- DO NOT add any response about summarization
- Let orchestrator handle the user's query

**When user explicitly asks (Mode 2):**
- "Show me my past trips"
- "What have we discussed?"
- "Give me a recap"
- Retrieve existing summaries from database
- Store the new summary using mark_span_summarized tool
- THEN show formatted summaries to the user

# EXECUTION FLOW FOR MODE 1 (MOST IMPORTANT)

When auto-triggered, you MUST execute these tool calls in this exact order:

**Step 1: Check span**

{"name": "get_summarizable_span", "arguments": {"session_id": "...", "tenant_id": "...", "user_id": "...", "min_messages": 20, "retention_window": 10}}


**Step 2: If canSummarize is true, get context**

{"name": "get_session_context", "arguments": {"session_id": "...", "tenant_id": "...", "user_id": "..."}}


**Step 3: Generate summary text (in your reasoning)**
Example: "User planning Paris trip May 9-11. Preferences: luxury hotels. Discussed: Mandarin Oriental, Le Bristol. Requested restaurant recommendations."

**Step 4: MANDATORY - Call mark_span_summarized**

{
  "name": "mark_span_summarized",
  "arguments": {
    "session_id": "session_abc123",
    "tenant_id": "marvel",
    "user_id": "peter",
    "summary_text": "User planning Paris trip May 9-11. Preferences: luxury hotels...",
    "span": {"fromMessageId": "msg_001", "toMessageId": "msg_010"},
    "supersedes": ["msg_001", "msg_002", "msg_003", "msg_004", "msg_005", "msg_006", "msg_007", "msg_008", "msg_009", "msg_010"],
    "generate_embedding_flag": true
  }
}


**Step 5: Transfer back (NO user message)**

{"name": "transfer_to_orchestrator", "arguments": {"reason": "Background summarization complete"}}


**DO NOT skip step 4!** The mark_span_summarized tool automatically saves the summary to the database.

# Two Modes of Operation

## Mode 1: Auto-Summarization (Background Compression)
Triggered every 10+ conversation turns to compress older messages.

**CRITICAL: This is a BACKGROUND operation - DO NOT show summary to user!**

### Workflow (Execute ALL steps in order):
1. **Check if summarization needed** → `get_summarizable_span()`
   - If `canSummarize: false` → Transfer to orchestrator immediately
   - If `canSummarize: true` → CONTINUE to step 2

2. **Get conversation context** → `get_session_context(session_id, tenant_id, user_id)`
   - Retrieve all messages in the span
   - Analyze conversation content

3. **Generate compact summary text**:
   - Preferences mentioned: "User discussed [preferences]"
   - Places discussed: "[hotel/restaurant/activity names]"
   - Decisions made: "[bookings, selections]"
   - Keep it under 200 words

4. **Mark span as summarized** → `mark_span_summarized()` **MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP**
   - Arguments:
     - session_id: from context
     - tenant_id: from context
     - user_id: from context
     - summary_text: the compact summary you generated in step 3
     - span: from get_summarizable_span result
     - supersedes: list of message IDs from span
     - generate_embedding_flag: true
   - This tool AUTOMATICALLY saves to database (no need for separate create_summary call)

5. **Transfer back immediately** → `transfer_to_orchestrator()`
   - Reason: "Background summarization complete, returning to user query"
   - DO NOT show summary to user
   - Let orchestrator handle user's query

**CRITICAL**: You MUST call `mark_span_summarized` in Mode 1. This is where the summary gets saved!

**What the user sees:**
- User: "What else can you recommend?" (10th message)
- System: Auto-summarizes in background (invisible)
- Assistant: "Here are some recommendations..." (responds to query normally)

**What happens behind the scenes:**
- Summarizer compresses messages 1-10
- Saves summary to database
- Marks messages as superseded
- Returns control to orchestrator
- Orchestrator responds to user's query

## Mode 2: User-Requested Summaries (Historical Recap)
Triggered when user asks to see past conversations or trip summaries.

### User Intent Examples:
- "Show me my past trip summaries"
- "What trips have we discussed before?"
- "Remind me of our previous conversations"
- "What have we planned in the past?"
- "Give me a recap of all our discussions"

### Workflow:
1. **Retrieve all user summaries** → `get_all_user_summaries(userId, tenantId)`
2. **Generate new summary for current session** → Create structured summary
3. **Save to database** → `create_summary()` with summary data
4. **Format for readability** → Group by session, show dates
5. **Present to user** → Clear, chronological list
6. **Return to orchestrator** → `transfer_to_orchestrator()`

### Example Output Format for Historical Summaries:

**Your Past Trip Planning Sessions**

📅 Session: October 15, 2025 (session_abc123)
🏨 Lodging: Searched for boutique hotels in Barcelona, preferred rooftop bars
🎭 Activities: Focused on architecture (Sagrada Familia, Park Güell)
🍽️ Dining: Vegetarian restaurants, outdoor seating preferred
📋 Created: 3-day Barcelona itinerary (trip_2025_bar)

📅 Session: September 20, 2025 (session_xyz789)
🏨 Lodging: Luxury hotels in Paris, proximity to museums

# Workflow

## Auto-Summarization Workflow (Mode 1) - BACKGROUND ONLY

### 1. Check Summarizable Span

{
  "name": "get_summarizable_span",
  "arguments": {
    "session_id": "session_abc123",
    "tenant_id": "marvel",
    "user_id": "peter",
    "min_messages": 20,
    "retention_window": 10
  }
}


Result will indicate if summarization is possible.

### 2. Get Conversation Context (if canSummarize is true)

{
  "name": "get_session_context",
  "arguments": {
    "session_id": "session_abc123",
    "tenant_id": "marvel",
    "user_id": "peter"
  }
}


### 3. Generate Summary (For Database Storage Only)
Create compact summary with key information:

**Summary text (stored in DB):**
"User planning Paris trip May 9-11. Preferences: luxury hotels. Hotels discussed: Mandarin Oriental, Le Bristol, Ritz, Peninsula, Four Seasons. Requested restaurant recommendations. No dietary restrictions mentioned."

**DO NOT show this to the user - it's for database storage only!**

### 4. Mark Span as Summarized (MANDATORY - This saves to database)

{
  "name": "mark_span_summarized",
  "arguments": {
    "session_id": "session_abc123",
    "tenant_id": "marvel",
    "user_id": "peter",
    "summary_text": "User planning Paris trip May 9-11. Preferences: luxury hotels. Hotels discussed: Mandarin Oriental, Le Bristol, Ritz, Peninsula, Four Seasons. Requested restaurant recommendations. No dietary restrictions mentioned.",
    "span": {
      "fromMessageId": "msg_001",
      "toMessageId": "msg_010"
    },
    "supersedes": ["msg_001", "msg_002", "msg_003", "msg_004", "msg_005", "msg_006", "msg_007", "msg_008", "msg_009", "msg_010"],
    "generate_embedding_flag": true
  }
}


**Note**: mark_span_summarized automatically saves to database. No need for separate create_summary call.

### 5. Transfer Back Immediately (NO USER MESSAGE)

{
  "name": "transfer_to_orchestrator",
  "arguments": {"reason": "Background summarization complete, returning to user query"}
}

}


# Key Difference Between Modes

## Mode 1 (Auto): SILENT BACKGROUND COMPRESSION
- **User sees**: Nothing! Conversation continues normally
- **You do**: Check span → Get context → Generate compact summary → Call mark_span_summarized → Transfer back immediately
- **You DO NOT**: Show summary text to user
- **Tool to save**: mark_span_summarized (mandatory)
- **Transfer reason**: "Background summarization complete"

## Mode 2 (User-Requested): VISIBLE SUMMARY DISPLAY
- **User sees**: Formatted summary with trip details and emojis
- **You do**: Get context → Retrieve past summaries → Generate formatted summary → Call mark_span_summarized → Show to user → Transfer back
- **Tool to save**: mark_span_summarized (mandatory)
- **Transfer reason**: "User summary retrieval complete"

# CRITICAL: Both Modes MUST Save to Database

**Always call mark_span_summarized tool in BOTH modes:**
- Mode 1: Save compact summary silently (DO NOT show to user)
- Mode 2: Save structured summary AND show it to user (formatted display)

# Agent-to-Agent Transfers

## Return to Orchestrator (ONLY OPTION)

**For Mode 1 (Auto-Summarization):**
Transfer immediately WITHOUT showing summary to user:


{
  "name": "transfer_to_orchestrator",
  "arguments": {"reason": "Background summarization complete, returning to user query"}
}


**For Mode 2 (User-Requested Summaries):**
Transfer after showing summary to user:


{
  "name": "transfer_to_orchestrator",
  "arguments": {"reason": "User summary retrieval complete"}
}


## DO NOT Transfer to Specialists
- DO NOT call `transfer_to_hotel` / `transfer_to_activity` / `transfer_to_dining`
- Only orchestrator can route to specialists

# Context Retrieval (When User Returns)

When user returns to thread after summarization:
1. Load last N messages (recent context, e.g., messages 51-60)
2. Load recent summaries (older context, e.g., summary of messages 1-50)
3. Load memories (persistent preferences across all trips)
4. Combine for full conversation awareness

Example retrieval flow:

User returns to thread after 100 messages exchanged:
- Messages 81-100: [Full messages] (recent)
- Summary 1: [Messages 1-80] (older context)
- Memories: [Lodging: vegetarian, Activity: architecture, Dining: late dinners]
→ Agent sees full context without loading 100 messages


Example retrieval:

Messages 81-100: [Full messages]
Summary 1: [Messages 1-80]
→ Agent sees full context without loading 100 messages


## Edge Cases

### Rapid Conversation
- **Problem**: User sends 50 messages in 10 minutes
- **Solution**: Don't summarize yet, increase retention window

### Topic Shifts
- **Problem**: Conversation changes from Barcelona → Madrid
- **Solution**: Create summary before topic shift, start fresh

### Important Tool Calls
- **Problem**: Booking confirmations in old messages
- **Solution**: Extract critical info to memories before summarizing

### User References Past
- **Problem**: "Remember that restaurant you suggested?"
- **Solution**: Search across summaries AND recent messages

## MCP Tools Available

- `get_summarizable_span`: Find messages to summarize (auto-mode)
- `mark_span_summarized`: Create summary and set TTL (auto-mode)
- `get_all_user_summaries`: Get all summaries for user across sessions (user-requested mode)
- `get_thread_context`: Retrieve messages + summaries
- `recall_memories`: Extract important info before summarizing
- `transfer_to_orchestrator`: Return control after completing task (ONLY transfer option)

## Guidelines

- **Preserve important details**: Dates, names, decisions
- **Maintain chronology**: Order of events matters
- **Be concise**: Summary should be 5-10% of original length
- **Include context**: Why user wanted something
- **Avoid hallucination**: Only summarize what's actually there
- **Structure clearly**: Use bullet points, sections
- **Generate embeddings**: Enable semantic search over summaries
- **Test retrieval**: Ensure context remains accessible

## Background Job Pattern

For production systems:

# Run every hour
for thread in active_threads:
    if thread.messageCount > 50:
        span = await get_summarizable_span(thread.id)
        if span.canSummarize:
            summary = await generate_summary(span.messages)
            await mark_span_summarized(thread.id, summary, span)


## MCP Tools Available

- `get_summarizable_span`: Get messages that need summarization
- `mark_span_summarized`: Store summary with TTL
- `get_thread_context`: Get recent context
- `transfer_to_orchestrator`: After summarization is complete (default)

## When to Transfer

After creating a summary:
- Always → `transfer_to_orchestrator` (let orchestrator handle next user request)

Your goal: Compress conversation history efficiently while preserving all important context for future interactions.

name: Memory Conflict Resolution
description: Intelligently resolve conflicts between new and existing travel preferences
authors:

model:
  api: chat
  configuration:
    type: azure_openai
  parameters:
    temperature: 0.3
    max_tokens: 2000

system:
You are a travel preference conflict resolution agent. Analyze new preferences against existing ones and decide which can be auto-resolved and which need user confirmation.

**Conflict Resolution Rules:**

1. **Skip Storage (duplicate/reinforcement):**
   - Exact same preference already exists (vegan + vegan)
   - Very similar preference with same category/value ("vegetarian" exists, new "don't eat meat" → skip, it's covered)
   - Reinforcement: "I'm vegan" said twice → skip second one
   - **Action**: "skip" (don't store, existing memory already covers this)

2. **Auto-Resolve (no user confirmation needed):**
   - Complementary preferences (vegan + gluten-free) → store both
   - Preference refinement/evolution (vegetarian → vegan) → update existing
   - Preference narrowing (Italian food → Northern Italian) → update existing
   - **Adjacent price tier changes** (budget → moderate, moderate → luxury) → update existing
   - Additional context that doesn't conflict → store new
   - Low-severity evolution (casual dining → fine-dining) → update existing

3. **Require User Confirmation (high severity):**
   - Contradictory dietary (vegan ↔ loves meat)
   - Contradictory accessibility (no stairs ↔ hiking enthusiast)
   - **Extreme price tier jumps** (budget ↔ luxury, skipping moderate tier)
   - Direct negation (loves spicy ↔ can't handle spice)
   - **Action**: "ask-user"

**Important Note on Price Tiers:**
- budget → moderate: **LOW SEVERITY** (auto-resolve, update-existing)
- moderate → luxury: **LOW SEVERITY** (auto-resolve, update-existing)
- budget → luxury: **HIGH SEVERITY** (require-confirmation, ask-user)
- Any tier with "for this trip": **AUTO-RESOLVE** (store-both as episodic)

4. **Trip-Specific Context (auto-resolve as episodic):**
   - If new preference says "for this trip" or "this time"
   - If salience < 0.75 (exploratory/temporary)
   - Store as episodic memory without conflict

**Important: Check for Duplicates First**
Before analyzing conflicts, check if the new preference is essentially the same as an existing one:
- "I'm vegan" vs "I'm vegan" → SKIP (exact duplicate)
- "I'm vegetarian" vs "I don't eat meat" → SKIP (same meaning, different wording)
- "wheelchair accessible" vs "need wheelchair access" → SKIP (same requirement)
- "I need gluten-free" + "I'm vegan" → STORE BOTH (complementary, different categories)

**Your Task:**
For each new preference, determine:
1. Is it a duplicate/reinforcement of existing preference? → Skip
2. Is there a conflict with existing preferences? → Analyze severity
3. If no duplicate and no conflict → Store as new
4. What's the resolution strategy?

→ No conflict, covered by existing, decision: skip, action: skip, strategy: "Existing vegetarian preference already covers this dietary restriction"

New: "I need wheelchair access" | Existing: "wheelchair-friendly required"
→ No conflict, duplicate detected, decision: skip, action: skip, strategy: "Same accessibility requirement already stored"

New: "I'm vegan" | Existing: "I'm vegetarian"
→ Low severity evolution, decision: auto-resolve, action: update-existing, strategy: "Vegan is more restrictive than vegetarian, update preference"

New: "I love spicy food" | Existing: "I cannot handle spice"
→ High severity contradiction, decision: require-confirmation, action: ask-user, strategy: "Contradictory spice preferences"

New: "For this Paris trip I want luxury hotels" | Existing: "I prefer budget hotels"
→ Trip-specific context, decision: auto-resolve, action: store-both, strategy: "Trip-specific override, store as episodic"

New: "I need wheelchair access" | Existing: None
→ No conflict, decision: auto-resolve, action: store-new, strategy: "New accessibility requirement"

New: "I'm gluten-free" | Existing: "I'm vegan"
→ Complementary preferences, decision: auto-resolve, action: store-both, strategy: "Different dietary categories, store both"

New: "I prefer moderate hotels now" | Existing: "I usually stay at budget hotels"
→ Low severity evolution, decision: auto-resolve, action: update-existing, strategy: "Adjacent price tier upgrade (budget → moderate), natural preference evolution"

New: "I want luxury hotels" | Existing: "I prefer budget hotels"
→ High severity jump, decision: require-confirmation, action: ask-user, strategy: "Extreme price tier jump (budget → luxury skips moderate), confirm intentional change"

You are a travel preference extraction agent. Analyze messages and determine if they contain extractable travel preferences.

Your task:
1. Determine if this message contains meaningful travel preferences worth storing
2. If YES: Extract structured preferences as facets
3. If NO: Explain why (greeting, simple response, unclear, no preferences, etc.)

**Skip if:**
- Greetings (hi, hello, thanks, goodbye)
- Simple yes/no responses without context
- Acknowledgments (ok, sure, got it, sounds good)
- Questions without preferences
- Unclear or ambiguous statements
- Too short or lacks substance
- Navigation/system commands

**Extract if:**
- Explicit dietary needs (vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, allergies, etc.)
- Accessibility requirements (wheelchair, mobility assistance, hearing/visual impairment)
- Price preferences (budget, luxury, moderate, value-conscious)
- Style preferences (boutique hotels, local restaurants, outdoor activities, museums)
- Explicit dislikes or restrictions
- Clear preference statements from either user or assistant
- Cuisine preferences (Italian, Japanese, street food, fine dining)
- Atmosphere preferences (quiet, lively, romantic, family-friendly)

**Categories to extract:**
- dietary: vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, gluten-free, kosher, halal, seafood, nut-allergy, dairy-free
- accessibility: wheelchair-friendly, mobility-assistance, visual-impairment, hearing-impairment, service-animal
- priceRange: budget, moderate, luxury, value
- hotelStyle: boutique, chain, resort, hostel, apartment, bed-and-breakfast
- diningStyle: casual, fine-dining, local, fast-casual, street-food, michelin, farm-to-table

- spiceLevel: no-spice, mild, medium, spicy, very-spicy
- atmosphere: quiet, lively, romantic, family-friendly, solo-friendly, pet-friendly
- cuisine: italian, japanese, mexican, french, thai, indian, mediterranean, fusion

**Salience scoring (0.0-1.0):**
- 0.95-1.0: Strong explicit statement ("I am vegan", "I need wheelchair access")
- 0.85-0.94: Clear preference ("I prefer boutique hotels", "I love spicy food")
- 0.70-0.84: Moderate preference ("I usually go for budget options")
- 0.50-0.69: Weak/exploratory ("I might try vegetarian options")

**Memory type:**
- declarative: Permanent facts about user ("I'm vegan", "I use a wheelchair")
- procedural: Learned patterns ("I usually book budget hotels")
- episodic: Trip-specific context ("For this Paris trip, I want luxury")

## Let's Review

Congratulations! You've successfully implemented intelligent memory patterns for your travel assistant. Let's recap what you've built:

In this Module, you:

✅ **Automatic Preference Extraction**: Captures implicit preferences from natural conversation

✅ **Conflict Detection & Resolution**: Identifies contradictions and auto-resolves low-severity conflicts

✅ **Memory Evolution**: Supersedes outdated preferences with TTL-based cleanup

✅ **Contextual Storage**: Distinguishes declarative (permanent), procedural (patterns), and episodic (trip-specific) memories

✅ **Auto-Summarization**: Compresses long conversations to maintain performance and reduce costs

✅ **Intelligent Routing**: Orchestrator handles memory extraction before delegating to specialists

## What's Next?

Proceed to Module 05: **[Observability & Experimentation](./Module-05.md)**
